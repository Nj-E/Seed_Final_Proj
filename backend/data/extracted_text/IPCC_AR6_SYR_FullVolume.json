    "text": "v\nForeword\nForeword\nThis Synthesis Report (SYR) concludes the Sixth Assessment Report \n(AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \nThe SYR synthesizes and integrates materials contained within the \nthree Working Groups Assessment Reports and the Special Reports \ncontributing to the AR6. It addresses a broad range of policy-relevant \nbut policy-neutral questions approved by the Panel. \nThe SYR is the synthesis of the most comprehensive assessment of \nclimate change undertaken thus far by the IPCC: Climate Change 2021: \nThe Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \nand Vulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate \nChange. The SYR also draws on the findings of three Special Reports \ncompleted as part of the Sixth Assessment – Global Warming of 1.5°C \n(2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of \n1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas \nemission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response \nto the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts \nto eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC \nSpecial Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, \nsustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas \nfluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere \nin a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC).\nThe AR6 SYR confirms that unsustainable and unequal energy and land use \nas well as more than a century of burning fossil fuels have unequivocally \ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C \nabove 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. This has led to widespread adverse \nimpacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. The \nnationally determined contributions (NDCs) committed by 2030 show the \ntemperature will increase by 1.5°C in the first half of the 2030s, and will \nmake it very difficult to control temperature increase by 2.0°C towards \nthe end of 21st century. Every increment of global warming will intensify \nmultiple and concurrent hazards in all regions of the world.\nThe report points out that limiting human-caused global warming \nrequires net zero CO2 emissions. Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation \nand accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade \nwould reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems \nand deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality and health. \nDelayed mitigation and adaptation action would lock-in high-emissions \ninfrastructure, raise risks of stranded assets and cost-escalation, reduce \nfeasibility, and increase losses and damages. Near-term actions involve \nhigh up-front investments and potentially disruptive changes that can \nbe lessened by a range of enabling policies. \nAs an intergovernmental body jointly established  in  1988  by \nthe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United \nNations Environment Programme (UNEP), the IPCC has provided \npolicymakers with the most authoritative and objective scientific \nand technical assessments in this field. Beginning in 1990, this \nseries of IPCC Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, \nMethodology Reports, and other products have become standard \nworks of reference. \nThe SYR was made possible thanks to the voluntary work, dedication \nand commitment of thousands of experts and scientists from around \nthe globe, representing a range of views and disciplines. We would like \nto express our deep gratitude to all the members of the Core Writing \nTeam of the SYR, members of the Extended Writing Team, Contributing \nAuthors, and the Review Editors, all of whom enthusiastically took on \nthe huge challenge of producing an outstanding SYR on top of the other \ntasks they had already committed to during the AR6 cycle. We would \nalso like to thank the staff of the Technical Support Unit of the SYR and \nthe IPCC Secretariat for their dedication in organizing the production of \nthis IPCC report. \nWe also wish to acknowledge and thank the governments of the IPCC \nmember countries for their support of scientists in developing this \nreport, and for their contributions to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide the \nessentials for participation of experts from developing countries and \ncountries with economies in transition. We would like to express our \nappreciation to the government of Singapore for hosting the Scoping \nMeeting of the SYR, to the government of Ireland for hosting the third \nCore Writing Team meeting of the SYR, and to the government of \nSwitzerland for hosting the 58th Session of the IPCC where the SYR \nwas approved. The generous financial support from the government of \nthe Republic of Korea enabled the smooth operation of the Technical \nSupport Unit of the SYR. This is gratefully acknowledged.\nWe would particularly like to express our thanks to the IPCC Chair, the \nIPCC Vice-Chairs and the Co-Chairs for their dedicated work throughout \nthe production of this report. \nPetteri Taalas\nSecretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization\nInger Andersen\nUnder-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director \nof the UN Environment Programme"

    "text": "vii\nThis Synthesis Report (SYR) constitutes the final product of the \nSixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC). It summarizes the state of knowledge of \nclimate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change \nmitigation and adaptation, based on the peer-reviewed scientific, \ntechnical, and socio-economic literature since the publication of the \nIPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. \nThis SYR distills, synthesizes, and integrates the key findings of the \nthree Working Group contributions – Climate Change 2021: The \nPhysical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and \nVulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. \nThe SYR also draws on the findings of three Special Reports completed \nas part of the Sixth Assessment –  Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): \nan IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C \nabove pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission \npathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the \nthreat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to \neradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC \nSpecial Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, \nsustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes \nin terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a \nChanging Climate (2019) (SROCC). The SYR, therefore, is a comprehensive, \ntimely compilation of assessments of the most recent scientific, technical, \nand socio-economic literature dealing with climate change.\nScope of the report\nThe SYR is a self-contained synthesis of the most policy-relevant \nmaterial drawn from the scientific, technical, and socio-economic \nliterature assessed during the Sixth Assessment. This report integrates \nthe main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports and the three \nAR6 Special Reports. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, \necosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of \ndiverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate \nadaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being, and \nsustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, \nincluding those from the physical and social sciences, this report \nidentifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, \nfeasible, just and equitable systems transitions, and climate resilient \ndevelopment pathways. Different regional classification schemes are \nused for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying \nliterature.  \nThe Synthesis Report emphasizes near-term risks and options for \naddressing them to give policymakers a sense of the urgency required \nto address global climate change. The report also provides important \ninsights about how climate risks interact with not only one another \nbut non-climate-related risks. It describes the interaction between \nmitigation and adaptation and how this combination can better \nconfront the climate challenge as well as produce valuable co-benefits. It \nhighlights the strong connection between equity and climate action and \nwhy more equitable solutions are vital to addressing climate change. It \nalso emphasizes how growing urbanization provides an opportunity for \nambitious climate action to advance climate resilient development and \nsustainable development for all. And it underscores how restoring and \nprotecting land and ocean ecosystems can bring multiple benefits to \nbiodiversity and other societal goals, just as a failure to do so presents \na major risk to ensuring a healthy planet. \nStructure\nThe SYR comprises a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and a longer report \nfrom which the SPM is derived, as well as annexes. \nTo facilitate access to the findings of the SYR for a wide readership, each \npart of the SPM carries highlighted headline statements. Taken together, \nthese 18 headline statements provide an overarching summary in \nsimple, non-technical language for easy assimilation by readers from \ndifferent walks of life. \nThe SPM follows a structure and sequence like that in the longer report, \nbut some issues covered in more than one section of the longer report \nare summarized in a single location in the SPM. Each paragraph of the \nSPM contains references to the supporting text in the longer report. \nIn turn, the longer report contains extensive references to relevant \nportions of the Working Group Reports or Special Reports mentioned \nabove. \nThe longer report is structured around three topic headings as \nmandated by the Panel. A brief Introduction (Section1) is followed by \nthree sections. \nSection 2, ‘Current Status and Trends’, opens with the assessment of \nobservational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current \ndrivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the \ncurrent implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options. \nSection 3, ‘Long-Term Climate and Development Futures’, provides an \nassessment of climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of \nsocio-economic futures. It considers long-term impacts, risks and costs \nin adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment. Section 4, ‘Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate’, \nassesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period to \n2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the \npursuit of sustainable development.\nAnnexes containing a glossary of terms used, list of acronyms, authors, \nReview Editors, the SYR Scientific Steering Committee, and Expert \nReviewers complete the report. \nPreface\nPreface"

A total of 30 CWT members and \n9 Review Editors were selected and accepted by the IPCC Bureau at its \n58th Session on 19 May 2020. In the process of developing the SYR, \n7 Extended Writing Team (EWT) authors were selected by the CWT and \napproved by the Chair and the IPCC Bureau, and 28 Contributing Authors \nwere selected by the CWT with the approval of the Chair. These \nadditional authors were to enhance and deepen the expertise required \nfor the preparation of the Report. The Chair established at the 58th \nSession of the Bureau an SYR Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) with a \nmandate to advise the development of the SYR. The SYR SSC comprised \nthe members of the IPCC Bureau, excluding those members who served \nas Review Editors for the SYR.\nDue to the covid pandemic, the first two meetings of the CWT were held \nvirtually from 25 to 29 January 2021 and from 16 to 20 August 2021. \nThe First Order Draft (FOD) was released to experts and governments \nfor review on 10 January 2022 with comments due on 20 March 2022. \nThe CWT met in Dublin from 25 to 28 March 2022 to discuss how \nbest to revise the FOD to address the more than 10,000 comments \nreceived. The Review Editors monitored the review process to \nensure that all comments received appropriate consideration. \nThe IPCC circulated a final draft of the Summary for Policymakers \nand a longer report of the SYR to governments for review from \n21 November 2022 to 15 January 2023 which resulted in over 6,000 \ncomments. A final SYR draft for approval incorporating the comments \nfrom the final government distribution was submitted to the IPCC \nmember governments on 8 March 2023.\nThe Panel at its 58th Session, held from 13 to 17 March 2023 in \nInterlaken, Switzerland, approved the SPM line by line and adopted the \nlonger report section by section. \nAcknowledgements\nThe SYR was made possible thanks to the hard work and commitment to \nexcellence shown by the Section Facilitators, members of CWT and EWT, \nand Contributing Authors. Specific thanks are due to Section Facilitators \nKate Calvin, Dipak Dasgupta, Gerhard Krinner, Aditi Mukherji, Peter Thorne, \nand Christopher Trisos whose work was essential in ensuring a high \nstandard of the longer report sections and the SPM.\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the IPCC member \ngovernments, observer organizations, and expert reviewers for providing \nconstructive comments on the draft reports. We would like to thank \nthe Review Editors Paola Arias, Mercedes Bustamante, Ismail Elgizouli, \nGregory Flato, Mark Howden, Steven Rose, Yamina Saheb, Roberto Sánchez, \nand Cunde Xiao for their work on the treatment of FOD comments, and \nGregory Flato, Carlos Méndez, Joy Jacqueline Pereira, Ramón Pichs-\nMadruga, Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, and Noureddine Yassaa for their work \nduring the approval session, collaborating with author teams to ensure \nconsistency between the SPM and the underlying reports.\nWe are grateful to the members of the SSC for their thoughtful advice \nand support for the SYR throughout the process: IPCC Vice-Chairs Ko \nBarret, Thelma Krug, and Youba Sokona; Co-Chairs of Working \nGroups (WG) and Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories \n(TFI)  Valérie Masson-Delmotte, Panmao Zhai, Hans-Otto Pörtner, \nDebra Roberts, Priyadarshi R.

It integrates the main findings of the Sixth \nAssessment Report (AR6) based on contributions from the three Working Groups1, and the three Special Reports2. The summary \nfor Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and \nLong-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. \nThis report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse \nforms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being \nand sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action. \nBased on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of \nconfidence using the IPCC calibrated language4.  \n1\t\nThe three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \nand Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication \nrespectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.\n2\t\nThe three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial \nlevels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable \ndevelopment, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land \ndegradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in \na Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and \n15 May 2019.\n3\t\nIn this report, the near term is defined as the period until 2040. The long term is defined as the period beyond 2040.\n4\t\nEach finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The IPCC calibrated language uses five qualifiers to express a level of \nconfidence: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms are used to indicate the \nassessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, \nabout as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; and \nextremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other \nAR6 Reports."

Current Status and Trends\nObserved Warming and its Causes\nA.1\t\nHuman activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally \ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 \nin 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal \nhistorical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and \nland-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, \nbetween and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). {2.1, Figure 2.1, \nFigure 2.2}\nA.1.1\t Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–19006, with larger increases \nover land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the first two \ndecades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature \nhas increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). \n{2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\nA.1.2 \t The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to \n1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed \na warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, \nnatural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability \nchanged it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\nA.1.3\t Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions \nfrom human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO2 \nof which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high \nconfidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 \nmillion years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per \nbillion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\nA.1.4\t Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) \nhigher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions \noccurring in CO2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest \nrelative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions \nduring 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and \n2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1). In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG \n5\t\nRanges given throughout the SPM represent very likely ranges (5–95% range) unless otherwise stated.\n6\t\nThe estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, \nmethodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the \nArctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase \ndoes not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\n7\t\nThe period distinction with A.1.1 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 \nis 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C.\n8\t\nContributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2] °C; \nmethane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. {2.1.1}\n9\t\nGHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-\nequivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to \nthe AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and \nassess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations \nand uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {2.1.1}"

Emissions reductions in CO2-FFI due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP \nand carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, \nenergy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. (high confidence) {2.1.1}\nA.1.5\t Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in \nterms of contributions to CO2-FFI and net CO2 emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF). \nIn 2019, around 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita11 (excluding \nCO2-LULUCF) while 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita; of the latter a substantial share lacks \naccess to modern energy services. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have \nmuch lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), \nexcluding CO2-LULUCF. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global \nconsumption-based household GHG emissions, while the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. (high confidence) {2.1.1, \nFigure 2.2}\nObserved Changes and Impacts\nA.2\t\nWidespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have \noccurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate \nextremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and \nrelated losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities \nwho have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately \naffected (high confidence). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)\nA.2.1\t It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by \n0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr-1 between 1901 \nand 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr-1 \nbetween 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at \nleast 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical \ncyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence \nhas likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of \nconcurrent heatwaves and droughts (high confidence). {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.1)\nA.2.2\t Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Human and \necosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high \nvulnerability to climatic hazards. Increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people \nto acute food insecurity12 and reduced water security, with the largest adverse impacts observed in many locations \nand/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands and the Arctic, and globally for \nIndigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers and low-income households. Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality \nfrom floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low \nvulnerability. (high confidence) {2.1.2, 4.4} (Figure SPM.1)\nA.2.3\t Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, \ncryospheric, and coastal and open ocean ecosystems (high confidence). Hundreds of local losses of species have been \ndriven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes (high confidence) with mass mortality events recorded on \nland and in the ocean (very high confidence). Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as \nthe impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain (medium \nconfidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw (high confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)\n10\t\nGHG emission levels are rounded to two significant digits; as a consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur. {2.1.1}\n11\t\nTerritorial emissions.\n12\t\nAcute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result \nof shocks risking determinants of food security and nutrition, and is used to assess the need for humanitarian action. {2.1}"

Ocean warming and \nocean acidification have adversely affected food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture in some oceanic \nregions (high confidence). Roughly half of the world’s population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least \npart of the year due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers (medium confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} \n(Figure SPM.1)\nA.2.5\t In all regions increases in extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity (very high confidence). \nThe occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases (very high confidence) and the incidence \nof vector-borne diseases (high confidence) have increased.

Examples of effective adaptation options include: cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and \nstorage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level \ndiversification in agriculture, sustainable land management approaches, use of agroecological principles and practices \nand other approaches that work with natural processes (high confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation17 approaches \nsuch as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been effective in reducing \nflood risks and urban heat (high confidence). Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and \nstructural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding (medium confidence).

There are widening disparities between the estimated costs \nof adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation (high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly \nfrom public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an \noverwhelming majority to mitigation (very high confidence). Although global tracked climate finance has shown \nan upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance \nsources, are insufficient and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries (high \nconfidence).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages \nand through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, \nparticularly for developing and least developed countries (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}\nBox SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report\nModelled scenarios and pathways19 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and \npossible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables \nand mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission \npathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, \nand have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about \nglobal equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions \nunderlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures.20 {Cross-Section Box.2}\nWGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)21 that \ncover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. High and \nvery high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.522) have CO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels \nby 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO2 emissions remaining around \ncurrent levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have CO2 \nemissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions. \nIn addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate changes, \nimpacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways \nwere categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways that limit \nwarming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to pathways \nthat exceed 4°C (C8). {Cross-Section Box.2} (Box SPM.1, Table 1)\nGlobal warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related \nimpacts and risks since patterns of changes for many variables at a given GWL are common to all scenarios considered and \nindependent of timing when that level is reached. {Cross-Section Box.2}\n19\t\nIn the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI \nprimarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when \nreferring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.\n20\t\nAround half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The \nother half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.\n21\t\nSSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the \nscenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {Cross-Section Box.2}\n22\t\nVery high emissions scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can \nalso occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {3.1.1}\n23\t\nRCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the \nscenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not \nidentical, with differences in concentration trajectories. The overall effective radiative forcing tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to the RCPs with the \nsame label (medium confidence). {Cross-Section Box.2}"

Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would \nlead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also \nto discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years (high confidence). \n{Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.1, 4.3} (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1)\nB.1.1\t\nGlobal warming28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) mainly due to increased cumulative \nCO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more \nlikely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to \nexceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates \nof the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global warming declines back \nto below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed \nclimate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range \nfrom 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario \n(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for \ncorresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)\nB.1.2\t\nDiscernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 \nand SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32 within around 20 years. Under \nthese contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air \nquality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions \nreductions.  Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years \ncompared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios \nthat combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions33.

Global surface \ntemperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-caused trend, due to natural variability. The internal variability of global \nsurface temperature in a single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence). The occurrence of individual years with global \nsurface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. {4.3, Cross-Section Box.2}\n29\t\nMedian five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered in WGIII is \n2030–2035. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and \n60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence). In all scenarios considered in WGI except the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), \nthe midpoint of the first 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change reaches 1.5°C lies in the \nfirst half of the 2030s.

The burning embers result from a literature \nbased expert elicitation. Panel (a): Left – Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 \nmodel simulations with observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity. Very \nlikely ranges are shown for the low and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) (Cross-Section Box.2). Right – Global Reasons for Concern \n(RFC), comparing AR6 (thick embers) and AR5 (thin embers) assessments. Risk transitions have generally shifted towards lower temperatures with updated \nscientific understanding. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming low to no adaptation. Lines connect the midpoints of the transitions from moderate to high \nrisk across AR5 and AR6. Panel (b): Selected global risks for land and ocean ecosystems, illustrating general increase of risk with global warming levels with low \nto no adaptation. Panel (c): Left - Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges \nbefore 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based \non emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and likely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Right - Assessment of the combined risk of coastal \nflooding, erosion and salinization for four illustrative coastal geographies in 2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels, under two response scenarios, \nwith respect to the SROCC baseline period (1986–2005). The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by \nmean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate \nresponse” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). “Maximum potential response” represent a combination of \nresponses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. \n(In this context, ‘today’ refers to 2019.) The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability, coastal hazards, in-situ responses and planned relocation. \nPlanned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlements. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, \nmay or may not be considered to be adaptation. Panel (d): Selected risks under different socio-economic pathways, illustrating how development strategies \nand challenges to adaptation influence risk. Left - Heat-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The diagrams are \ntruncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP scenarios. Right - Risks associated with food security due to \nclimate change and patterns of socio-economic development. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including population at risk of hunger, \nfood price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed for two contrasted socio-economic \npathways (SSP1 and SSP3) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation and adaptation policies. {Figure 3.3} (Box SPM.1)\nLikelihood and Risks of Unavoidable, Irreversible or Abrupt \nChanges\nB.3\t\nSome future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible but can be limited by deep, rapid, \nand sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The likelihood of abrupt and/or \nirreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels. Similarly, the probability \nof low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increases \nwith higher global warming levels. (high confidence) {3.1}\nB.3.1\t\nLimiting global surface temperature does not prevent continued changes in climate system components that have \nmulti-decadal or longer timescales of response (high confidence). Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia \ndue to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years \n(high confidence). However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise \nacceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment. Relative to 1995–2014, the likely global mean sea \nlevel rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is 0.15–0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28–0.55 m by 2100; while for the \nSSP5-8.5 GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20–0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63–1.01 m by 2100 (medium confidence). Over the \nnext 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to \n2°C (low confidence). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4} (Box SPM.1)\nB.3.2\t\nThe likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered \nwhen tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence). As warming levels increase, so \ndo the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests (medium confidence), \ncoral reefs (very high confidence) and in Arctic regions (high confidence). At sustained warming levels between 2°C and \n3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, \ncausing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher \nglobal surface temperatures (high confidence). {3.1.2, 3.1.3}\nB.3.3\t\nThe probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global \nwarming levels (high confidence). Due to deep uncertainty linked to ice-sheet processes, global mean sea level rise \nabove the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under the very high GHG emissions \nscenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be excluded. There is medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional \nOverturning Circulation will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt \nshifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. {3.1.3} (Box SPM.1)"

With increasing global warming, losses and \ndamages will increase and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation \nlimits. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term \nplanning and implementation of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and \nsystems. (high confidence) {3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3}\nB.4.1\t\nThe effectiveness of adaptation, including ecosystem-based and most water-related options, will decrease with \nincreasing warming. The feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that \ndifferentiate responses based on climate risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. As adaptation options \noften have long implementation times, long-term planning increases their efficiency. (high confidence) {3.2, Figure 3.4, \n4.1, 4.2} \nB.4.2\t\nWith additional global warming, limits to adaptation and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among vulnerable \npopulations, will become increasingly difficult to avoid (high confidence). Above 1.5°C of global warming, limited \nfreshwater resources pose potential hard adaptation limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier \nand snow melt (medium confidence). Above that level, ecosystems such as some warm-water coral reefs, coastal \nwetlands, rainforests, and polar and mountain ecosystems will have reached or surpassed hard adaptation limits and as \na consequence, some Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures will also lose their effectiveness (high confidence). {2.3.2, \n3.2, 4.3}\nB.4.3\t\nActions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation over the long \nterm, creating lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult to change. For example, seawalls effectively \nreduce impacts to people and assets in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate \nrisks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan. Maladaptive responses can worsen \nexisting inequities especially for Indigenous Peoples and marginalised groups and decrease ecosystem and biodiversity \nresilience. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term planning and implementation \nof adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {2.3.2, 3.2}\nCarbon Budgets and Net Zero Emissions\nB.5\t\nLimiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions. Cumulative carbon \nemissions until the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions and the level of greenhouse \ngas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to \n1.5°C or 2°C (high confidence). Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure \nwithout additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%) \n(high confidence). {2.3, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1}\nB.5.1\t\nFrom a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative \nCO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. \nReaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and \nimplies net negative CO2 emissions39. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 \nemissions (see B.6). Net zero GHG emissions, if sustained, are projected to result in a gradual decline in global surface \ntemperatures after an earlier peak.

The best estimates of the remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of 2020 are \n500 GtCO2 for a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for a 67% likelihood of limiting \nwarming to 2°C40.

Most countries report their \nanthropogenic land CO2 fluxes including fluxes due to human-caused environmental change (e.g., CO2 fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their national \nGHG inventories. Using emissions estimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {3.3.1}\n41\t\nFor example, remaining carbon budgets could be 300 or 600 GtCO2 for 1.5°C (50%), respectively for high and low non-CO2 emissions, compared to \n500 GtCO2 in the central case. {3.3.1}"

For example, in modelled pathways that limit \nwarming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, global methane emissions are reduced by 34 [21–57]% by 2030 \nrelative to 2019. However, some hard-to-abate residual GHG emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, aviation, \nshipping, and industrial processes) remain and would need to be counterbalanced by deployment of CDR methods to \nachieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions (high confidence). As a result, net zero CO2 is reached earlier than net zero GHGs \n(high confidence). {3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.5} (Figure SPM.5)\nB.6.3\t\nGlobal modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels \nwithout carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels \nwith CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR47. In most global \nmodelled pathways, land-use change and forestry (via reforestation and reduced deforestation) and the energy supply \nsector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. (high confidence) {3.3.3, \n4.1, 4.5, Figure 4.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)\nB.6.4\t\nMitigation options often have synergies with other aspects of sustainable development, but some options can also \nhave trade-offs. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency \nand renewable energy. Similarly, depending on the context48, biological CDR methods like reforestation, improved \nforest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management can enhance \nbiodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods. However, afforestation or production of \nbiomass crops can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water \nsecurity, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land \ntenure is insecure. Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or that shift global development \ntowards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as less dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity. \n(high confidence) {3.4.1}\n47\t\nCCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO2 is \ncaptured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and \nsubsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the \npower sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated \nto be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which is more than the CO2 storage requirements through 2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional \navailability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the CO2 \ncan be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental \nand socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. \nEnabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers.

Coloured ranges denote the 5th to 95th percentile across the global modelled pathways falling within a given category as described in Box SPM.1. \nThe red ranges depict emissions pathways assuming policies that were implemented by the end of 2020.

Global emission pathways that would limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and also reach net zero GHG in the second half of the \ncentury do so between 2070–2075.

This would require additional \ndeployment of carbon dioxide removal, compared to pathways without overshoot, leading \nto greater feasibility and sustainability concerns. Overshoot entails adverse impacts, some \nirreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems, all growing with the \nmagnitude and duration of overshoot.

Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions, with annual rates \nof CDR greater than residual CO2 emissions, would gradually reduce the warming level again (high confidence). Adverse \nimpacts that occur during this period of overshoot and cause additional warming via feedback mechanisms, such as \nincreased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and permafrost thawing, weakening natural land \ncarbon sinks and increasing releases of GHGs would make the return more challenging (medium confidence). {3.3.2, \n3.3.4, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6} (Box SPM.1)\nB.7.2\t\nThe higher the magnitude and the longer the duration of overshoot, the more ecosystems and societies are exposed \nto greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, increasing risks for many natural and human \nsystems. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies would face higher risks to infrastructure, low-lying \ncoastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain \necosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier \nmelt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. (high confidence) {3.1.2, 3.3.4}\nB.7.3\t\nThe larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions would be needed to return to 1.5°C by 2100.

Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and \ngeophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For \npotential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and \nlow. The right-hand side of Panel a provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Costs are net lifetime \ndiscounted monetary costs of avoided GHG emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and \ntime and in the longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced \nsinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios \nfrom the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included \nmostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching \nto electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy \ncontext dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options \nfor 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the \nsectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. \nThe green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest \nand the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use \npatterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use \nsectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional \nenergy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows \nthe projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, \nthis projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural \nfactors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow). {Figure 4.4} \nMitigation and Adaptation Options across Systems \nC.3\t\nRapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve \ndeep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. \nThese system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and \nadaptation options.

Feasible, \neffective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available (high confidence). The availability, \nfeasibility and potential of mitigation and adaptation options in the near term differs across systems and regions (very \nhigh confidence). {4.1, 4.5.1 to 4.5.6} (Figure SPM.7)\nEnergy Systems \nC.3.2\t Net zero CO2 energy systems entail: a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil \nfuels51, and use of carbon capture and storage in the remaining fossil fuel systems; electricity systems that emit no \nnet CO2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in applications less amenable to electrification; energy \nconservation and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy system (high confidence). Large contributions \nto emissions reductions with costs less than USD 20 tCO2-eq-1 come from solar and wind energy, energy efficiency \nimprovements, and methane emissions reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste) (medium confidence). There are \nfeasible adaptation options that support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efficient water use for \nexisting and new energy generation systems (very high confidence). Energy generation diversification (e.g., via wind, \nsolar, small scale hydropower) and demand-side management (e.g., storage and energy efficiency improvements) can \nincrease energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change (high confidence).

Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests \nand other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical \nregions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to \ntrade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple \nobjectives including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable healthy diets53 and reducing food loss/\nwaste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion, and methane and nitrous oxide \nemissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agricultural and forest \nproducts, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. \nEffective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and \nlandscape diversification, and urban agriculture.

It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming \nof 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) \ncontributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) \ndrivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal \nvariability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, \nWGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}\nObserved increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around \n1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. \nLand and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion \n(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over \n63\t\nIn this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)\n64\t\nThe estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological \nadvances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements \nhave also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 \n{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}\n65\t\nFor 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and \n0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. \n66\t\nThe period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is \n1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WGI SPM footnote 11}\n67\t\nContributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; methane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; \nnitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C.\n68\t\nFor 2021 (the most recent year for which final numbers are available) concentrations using the same observational products and methods as in AR6 WGI are: 415 ppm CO2; \n1896 ppb CH4; and 335 ppb N2O. Note that the CO2 is reported here using the WMO-CO2-X2007 scale to be consistent with WGI. Operational CO2 reporting has since been \nupdated to use the WMO-CO2-X2019 scale.\nthe past six decades, with regional differences (high confidence). In 2019, \natmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million (ppm), CH4 \nreached 1866 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) reached 332 ppb68. \nOther major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone (O3) and \nhalogenated gases. Concentrations of CH4 and N2O have increased to \nlevels unprecedented in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence), \nand there is high confidence that current CO2 concentrations are \nhigher than at any time over at least the past two million years.

Emissions of GHG have \nincreased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net \nanthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel \ncombustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); \nnet CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF) \n(green); CH4; N2O; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) \n(light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric \nconcentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed \nGHGs CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their \nrelative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and \nN2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, \nin the case of CH4 indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts \non tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature \nchange from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. This estimate arises from \nan assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. \nThe global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from \na 1850–1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since \n1850–1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the \nestimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest \nmulti-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which \noccurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial \nperiod (Holocene).

These past warm periods were caused \nby slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and \nattribution studies synthesise information from climate models \nand observations and show that the best estimate is that all the \nwarming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused \nby humans (panel (d)).

Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to \nDate\nIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the \natmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in \nthe atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred \n(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as \na whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system \nare unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It \nis very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric \nwarming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone \ndepletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 \nand the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean \n(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that \nhuman influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for \n91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss \nand atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, \nrespectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 \n[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level \nrise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to \n1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing \nto 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). \nHuman influence was very likely the main driver of these increases \nsince at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main \ndriver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease \nin Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human \ninfluence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere \nspring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is \nvirtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver \nof current global acidification of the surface open ocean. {WGI SPM A.1, \nWGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, \nWGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2}\nHuman-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and \nclimate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed \nchanges in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, \nand tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human \ninfluence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3).

The extent \nand magnitude of climate change impacts are larger than estimated \nin previous assessments (high confidence). Approximately half of the \nspecies assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to \nhigher elevations (very high confidence). Biological responses including \nchanges in geographic placement and shifting seasonal timing are often \nnot sufficient to cope with recent climate change (very high confidence). \nHundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in \nthe magnitude of heat extremes (high confidence) and mass mortality \nevents on land and in the ocean (very high confidence).

Impacts in ecosystems \nfrom slow-onset processes such as ocean acidification, sea level rise \nor regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed to \nhuman-caused climate change (high confidence).

Animal and \nhuman diseases, including zoonoses, are emerging in new areas (high \nconfidence). In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are \nassociated with increasing temperatures (high confidence), trauma from \nextreme events (very high confidence), and loss of livelihoods and culture \nFigure 2.3: Both vulnerability to current climate extremes and historical contribution to climate change are highly heterogeneous with many of those who have \nleast contributed to climate change to date being most vulnerable to its impacts. Panel (a) The IPCC AR6 WGI inhabited regions are displayed as hexagons with identical size \nin their approximate geographical location (see legend for regional acronyms). All assessments are made for each region as a whole and for the 1950s to the present. Assessments made \non different time scales or more local spatial scales might differ from what is shown in the figure. The colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on observed \nchanges. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole, and grey hexagons are used when there is limited \ndata and/or literature that prevents an assessment of the region as a whole. Other colours indicate at least medium confidence in the observed change. The confidence level for the human \ninfluence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend detection and attribution and event attribution literature, and it is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for \nhigh confidence, two dots for medium confidence and one dot for low confidence (single, filled dot: limited agreement; single, empty dot: limited evidence). For hot extremes, the evidence \nis mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on daily maximum temperatures; regional studies using other indices (heatwave duration, frequency and intensity) are used in addition. For \nheavy precipitation, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in indices based on one-day or five-day precipitation amounts using global and regional studies. Agricultural and \necological droughts are assessed based on observed and simulated changes in total column soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water \nbalance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and indices driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand. Panel (b) shows the average level of vulnerability amongst a \ncountry’s population against 2019 CO2-FFI emissions per- capita per country for the 180 countries for which both sets of metrics are available. Vulnerability information is based on two \nglobal indicator systems, namely INFORM and World Risk Index. Countries with a relatively low average vulnerability often have groups with high vulnerability within their population and \nvice versa. The underlying data includes, for example, information on poverty, inequality, health care infrastructure or insurance coverage. Panel (c) Observed impacts on ecosystems \nand human systems attributed to climate change at global and regional scales. Global assessments focus on large studies, multi-species, meta-analyses and large reviews. Regional \nassessments consider evidence on impacts across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. For human systems, the direction of impacts is assessed and both \nadverse and positive impacts have been observed e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item (for more details and \nmethodology see WGII SMTS.1).  Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and demand for water. \nGlobal mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels reflect the assessment of attribution of the observed impact to climate change. \n{WGI Figure SPM.3, Table TS.5, Interactive Atlas; WGII Figure SPM.2, WGII SMTS.1, WGII 8.3.1, Figure 8.5; ; WGIII 2.2.3}"

While global net GHG emissions have increased since \n2010, global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) \ndecreased by 2% yr–1 between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon \nintensity (CO2-FFI per unit primary energy) also decreased by 0.3% \nyr–1, mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion \nof coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large \nregional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies \nhave enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and \naccelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some \ncases reduced or removed emissions (high confidence). At least \n18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 and GHG and \nconsumption-based CO2 absolute emission reductions for longer than \n10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy \nefficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from \nboth policies and changes in economic structure (high confidence). \nSome countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a \nthird or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates \nof around 4% yr–1 for several years consecutively (high confidence). \nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to \navoided global emissions of several GtCO2-eq yr–1 (medium confidence)."

Future additional warming will depend on future emissions, \nwith total warming dominated by past and future cumulative CO2 emissions. {WGI SPM D.1.1, WGI Figure SPM.4; SR1.5 SPM A.2.2} \nReaching net zero CO2 emissions is different from reaching net zero GHG emissions. The timing of net zero for a basket of GHGs depends \non the emissions metric, such as global warming potential over a 100-year period, chosen to convert non-CO2 emissions into CO2-equivalent (high \nconfidence). However, for a given emissions pathway, the physical climate response is independent of the metric chosen (high confidence). \n{WGI SPM D.1.8; WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 2}\nAchieving global net zero GHG emissions requires all remaining CO2 and metric-weighted98 non-CO2 GHG emissions to be \ncounterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals (high confidence). Some non-CO2 emissions, such as CH4 and N2O from agriculture, \ncannot be fully eliminated using existing and anticipated technical measures. {WGIII SPM C.2.4, WGIII SPM C.11.4, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3}\nGlobal net zero CO2 or GHG emissions can be achieved even if some sectors and regions are net emitters, provided that \nothers reach net negative emissions (see Figure 4.1). The potential and cost of achieving net zero or even net negative emissions \nvary by sector and region. If and when net zero emissions for a given sector or region are reached depends on multiple factors, including \nthe potential to reduce GHG emissions and undertake carbon dioxide removal, the associated costs, and the availability of policy \nmechanisms to balance emissions and removals between sectors and countries. (high confidence) {WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3}\nThe adoption and implementation of net zero emission targets by countries and regions also depend on equity and capacity \nconsiderations (high confidence). The formulation of net zero pathways by countries will benefit from clarity on scope, plans-of-action, and \nfairness. Achieving net zero emission targets relies on policies, institutions, and milestones against which to track progress. Least-cost global \nmodelled pathways have been shown to distribute the mitigation effort unevenly, and the incorporation of equity principles could change the \ncountry-level timing of net zero (high confidence). The Paris Agreement also recognizes that peaking of emissions will occur later in developing \ncountries than developed countries (Article 4.1). {WGIII Box TS.6, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 3, WGIII 14.3}\nMore information on country-level net zero pledges is provided in Section 2.3.1, on the timing of global net zero emissions in Section 3.3.2, and \non sectoral aspects of net zero in Section 4.1.\n98\t\nSee footnote 12 above."

More than 100 countries have either adopted, \nannounced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO2 emissions \ncommitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. \nA growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero \nGHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced \nnet zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission \npledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and \nlimited policies are to date in place to deliver on them. {WGIII SPM C.6.4, \nWGIII TS.4.1, WGIII Table TS.1, WGIII 13.9, WGIII 14.3, WGIII 14.5} \nAll mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, \nincluding technology risks, scaling, and costs (high confidence). \nAlmost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that \nneed to be addressed to enable their application at scale (medium \nconfidence). Current development pathways may create behavioural, \nspatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all \nscales (high confidence). Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the \nprivate sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development \npathways (high confidence). Structural factors of national circumstances \nand capabilities (e.g., economic and natural endowments, political \nsystems and cultural factors and gender considerations) affect the \nbreadth and depth of climate governance (medium confidence). The \nextent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, \nlabour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged \ninfluences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual \npolicy outcomes (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM C.3.6, WGIII SPM E.1.1, \nWGIII SPM E.2.1, WGIII SPM E.3.3}\nThe adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most \ndeveloping countries, particularly least developed ones, \ndue in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited \nfinance, technology development and transfer, and capacity \n(medium confidence). In many countries, especially those with \nlimited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have \nbeen observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, \ne.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge \nand suppliers (medium confidence). Low-emission innovation along \nwith strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development \nbenefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public \nsupport for policy (medium confidence). Persistent and region-specific \nbarriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility \nof deploying AFOLU mitigation options (medium confidence). Barriers to \nimplementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and \nfinancial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, \nweak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack \nof access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal (high \nconfidence). {WGIII SPM B.4.2, WGIII SPM C.9.1, WGIII SPM C.9.3} \n99\t\nSee Annex I: Glossary. \n100\t  Adaptation limit: The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. Hard adaptation limit \n- No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. Soft adaptation limit - Options are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.\n101\t Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability \nto climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence. See Annex I: Glossary.\n2.3.2. Adaptation Gaps and Barriers \nDespite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current \nlevels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts \nand reduce climate risks (high confidence). While progress in \nadaptation implementation is observed across all sectors and regions \n(very high confidence), many adaptation initiatives prioritise immediate \nand near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard flood protection, \nwhich reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation99 (high \nconfidence). Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, \nincremental, sector-specific, and focused more on planning rather than \nimplementation (high confidence). Further, observed adaptation is \nunequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation gaps \nexist among lower population income groups (high confidence). In the \nurban context, the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage \ncomplex risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or \nthe inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk (high confidence). \nMany funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective \nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation and current adaptation \nefforts are not expected to meet existing goals (high confidence). \nAt current rates of adaptation planning and implementation the \nadaptation gap will continue to grow (high confidence). {WGII SPM C.1, \nWGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.4.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.1.4} \nSoft and hard adaptation limits100 have already been reached in \nsome sectors and regions, in spite of adaptation having buffered \nsome climate impacts (high confidence). Ecosystems already \nreaching hard adaptation limits include some warm water coral reefs, \nsome coastal wetlands, some rainforests, and some polar and mountain \necosystems (high confidence). Individuals and households in low lying \ncoastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers \nin Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia have reached \nsoft limits (medium confidence), resulting from financial, governance, \ninstitutional and policy constraints and can be overcome by addressing \nthese constraints (high confidence). Transitioning from incremental to \ntransformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits \n(high confidence). {WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM C.3.2, \nWGII SPM C.3.3, WGII SPM.C.3.4, WGII 16 ES}\nAdaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with \neffective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses \nand damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and \nsectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, \ngovernance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable \ndeveloping countries. (high confidence) {WGII SPM.C.3.5}\nThere is increased evidence of maladaptation101 in various sectors \nand regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas \n(e.g., new urban infrastructure that cannot be adjusted easily or affordably), \nagriculture (e.g., using high-cost irrigation in areas projected to have more \nintense drought conditions), ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally"

Maladaptation especially affects marginalised and vulnerable \ngroups adversely (e.g., Indigenous Peoples, ethnic minorities, low-income \nhouseholds, people living in informal settlements), reinforcing and \nentrenching existing inequities. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, \nmulti-sectoral, inclusive and long-term planning and implementation of \nadaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems. (high \nconfidence) {WGII SPM C.4, WGII SPM C.4.3, WGII TS.D.3.1}\nSystemic barriers constrain the implementation of adaptation \noptions in vulnerable sectors, regions and social groups (high \nconfidence). Key barriers include limited resources, lack of private-sector \nand civic engagement, insufficient mobilisation of finance, lack of political \ncommitment, limited research and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation \nscience and a low sense of urgency. Inequity and poverty also constrain \nadaptation, leading to soft limits and resulting in disproportionate \nexposure and impacts for most vulnerable groups (high confidence). The \nlargest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups \n(high confidence). As adaptation options often have long implementation \ntimes, long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly \nin this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that \nconstraints remain for some regions (high confidence). Prioritisation of \noptions and transitions from incremental to transformational adaptation \nare limited due to vested interests, economic lock-ins, institutional \npath dependencies and prevalent practices, cultures, norms and belief \nsystems (high confidence). Many funding, knowledge and practice \ngaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation \nof adaptation (high confidence), including, lack of climate literacy at \nall levels and limited availability of data and information (medium \nconfidence); for example for Africa, severe climate data constraints and \ninequities in research funding and leadership reduce adaptive capacity \n(very high confidence). {WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII TS.D.1.3, \nWGII TS.D.1.5, WGII TS.D.2.4}\n2.3.3. Lack of Finance as a Barrier to Climate Action \nInsufficient financing, and a lack of political frameworks and \nincentives for finance, are key causes of the implementation \ngaps for both mitigation and adaptation (high confidence). \nFinancial flows remained heavily focused on mitigation, are \nuneven, and have developed heterogeneously across regions \nand sectors (high confidence). In 2018, public and publicly mobilised \nprivate climate finance flows from developed to developing countries \nwere below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement \nto mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of \nmeaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation \n(medium confidence). Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels \nare still greater than those for climate adaptation and mitigation (high \nconfidence). The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance \nis directed towards mitigation (very high confidence). Nevertheless, \naverage annual modelled investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 \nin scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three \nto six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments \n(public, private, domestic and international) would need to increase \nacross all sectors and regions (medium confidence). Challenges \nremain for green bonds and similar products, in particular around \nintegrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of \nthese markets to many developing countries (high confidence). \n{WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM B.5.4, WGIII SPM E.5.1} \nCurrent global financial flows for adaptation including from public \nand private finance sources, are insufficient for and constrain \nimplementation of adaptation options, especially in developing \ncountries (high confidence). There are widening disparities between \nthe estimated costs of adaptation and the documented finance \nallocated to adaptation (high confidence). Adaptation finance \nneeds are estimated to be higher than those assessed in AR5, and \nthe enhanced mobilisation of and access to financial resources are \nessential for implementation of adaptation and to reduce adaptation \ngaps (high confidence). Annual finance flows targeting adaptation for \nAfrica, for example, are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation \ncost estimates for near-term climate change (high confidence). Adverse \nclimate impacts can further reduce the availability of financial resources \nby causing losses and damages and impeding national economic \ngrowth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation \nparticularly for developing countries and LDCs (medium confidence). \n{WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.3.2, WGII SPM C.5.4, WGII TS.D.1.6} \nWithout effective mitigation and adaptation, losses and damages will \ncontinue to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable \npopulations. Accelerated financial support for developing countries \nfrom developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler to \nenhance mitigation action {WGIII SPM. E.5.3}. Many developing \ncountries lack comprehensive data at the scale needed and lack adequate \nfinancial resources needed for adaptation for reducing associated \neconomic and non-economic losses and damages. (high confidence) \n{WGII Cross-Chapter Box LOSS, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM C.3.2, \nWGII TS.D.1.3, WGII TS.D.1.5; WGIII SPM E.5.3} \nThere are barriers to redirecting capital towards climate action both \nwithin and outside the global financial sector. These barriers include: \nthe inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment \nopportunities, regional mismatch between available capital and \ninvestment needs, home bias factors, country indebtedness levels, \neconomic vulnerability, and limited institutional capacities. Challenges \nfrom outside the financial sector include: limited local capital markets; \nunattractive risk-return profiles, in particular due to missing or weak \nregulatory environments that are inconsistent with ambition levels; \nlimited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards; standardisation, \naggregation, scalability and replicability of investment opportunities \nand financing models; and, a pipeline ready for commercial investments. \n(high confidence) {WGII SPM C.5.4; WGIII SPM E.5.2; SR1.5 SPM D.5.2}"

These are quantitative \nprojections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission pathways, including those based on cost effective approaches \ncontain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, and have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most \ndo not make explicit assumptions about global equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard \nto the assumptions underlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures103. {WGI Box SPM.1; \nWGII Box SPM.1; WGIII Box SPM.1; SROCC Box SPM.1; SRCCL Box SPM.1} \nSocio-economic Development, Scenarios, and Pathways\nThe five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1 to SSP5) were designed to span a range of challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. \nFor the assessment of climate impacts, risk and adaptation, the SSPs are used for future exposure, vulnerability and challenges to adaptation. \nDepending on levels of GHG mitigation, modelled emissions scenarios based on the SSPs can be consistent with low or high warming levels104. \nThere are many different mitigation strategies that could be consistent with different levels of global warming in 2100 (see Figure 4.1). \n{WGI Box SPM.1; WGII Box SPM.1; WGIII Box SPM.1, WGIII Box TS.5, WGIII Annex III; SRCCL Box SPM.1, SRCCL Figure SPM.2}\nWGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on SSPs105 that cover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic \ndrivers of climate change found in the literature. These scenarios combine socio-economic assumptions, levels of climate mitigation, land use and \nair pollution controls for aerosols and non-CH4 ozone precursors. The high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) have \nCO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively106. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) \nhas CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and \nSSP1-2.6) have CO2 emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 \nemissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)107 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate changes, \nimpacts and risks. {WGI Box SPM.1} (Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)\nIn WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways were categorised based on their \nprojected global warming over the 21st century, with categories ranging from pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% \nlikelihood108 with no or limited overshoot (C1) to pathways that exceed 4°C (C8). Methods to project global warming associated with the \nmodelled pathways were updated to ensure consistency with the AR6 WGI assessment of the climate system response109. {WGIII Box SPM.1,WGIII \nTable 3.1} (Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)\n102\t In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI primarily used the term \nscenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emissions and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when referring to WGI and modelled emissions and \nmitigation pathways when referring to WGIII. {WGI Box SPM.1; WGIII footnote 44}\n103\t Around half of all modelled global emissions pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The other half look \nat existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.  The underlying population assumptions range from 8.5 to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 7.4 to 10.9 billion \nin 2100 (5–95th percentile) starting from 7.6 billion in 2019. The underlying assumptions on global GDP growth range from 2.5 to 3.5% per year in the 2019–2050 period \nand 1.3 to 2.1% per year in the 2050–2100 (5–95th percentile). {WGIII Box SPM.1}\n104\t High mitigation challenges, for example, due to assumptions of slow technological change, high levels of global population growth, and high fragmentation as in the Shared \nSocio-economic Pathway SSP3, may render modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (> 67%) or lower infeasible (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM C.1.4; SRCCL Box SPM.1}\n105\t SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios, and \n‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or Wm–2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {WGI SPM footnote 22}\n106\t Very high emission scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Temperature levels > 4°C may result from very high emission scenarios, but can also occur from \nlower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {WGIII SPM C.1.3}\n107\t RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or Wm–2) resulting from the scenario in the \nyear 2100. {WGII SPM footnote 21}\n108\t Denoted ‘>50%’ in this report.\n109\t The climate response to emissions is investigated with climate models, paleoclimatic insights and other lines of evidence.

Many climate-related risks are assessed to be \nhigher than in previous assessments, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher than \ncurrently observed. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in compounding and cascading \nrisks across sectors and regions. Sea level rise, as well as other irreversible changes, will continue for thousands \nof years, at rates depending on future emissions. (high confidence)\n3.1.1. Long-term Climate Change\nThe uncertainty range on assessed future changes in global \nsurface temperature is narrower than in the AR5. For the first \ntime in an IPCC assessment cycle, multi-model projections of global \nsurface temperature, ocean warming and sea level are constrained \nusing observations and the assessed climate sensitivity. The likely \nrange of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been narrowed to 2.5°C \nto 4.0°C (with a best estimate of 3.0°C) based on multiple lines of \nevidence112, including improved understanding of cloud feedbacks. For \nrelated emissions scenarios, this leads to narrower uncertainty ranges \nfor long-term projected global temperature change than in AR5. \n{WGI A.4, WGI Box SPM.1, WGI TS.3.2, WGI 4.3}\nFuture warming depends on future GHG emissions, with \ncumulative net CO2 dominating. The assessed best estimates and \nvery likely ranges of warming for 2081-2100 with respect to 1850–1900 \nvary from 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8]°C in the very low GHG emissions scenario \n(SSP1-1.9) to 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C in the intermediate GHG emissions \nscenario (SSP2-4.5) and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7]°C in the very high GHG emissions \nscenario (SSP5-8.5)113. {WGI SPM B.1.1, WGI Table SPM.1, WGI Figure \nSPM.4} (Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)\nModelled pathways consistent with the continuation of policies \nimplemented by the end of 2020 lead to global warming of \n3.2 [2.2 to 3.5]°C (5–95% range) by 2100 (medium confidence) \n(see also Section 2.3.1). Pathways of >4°C (≥50%) by 2100 would \nimply a reversal of current technology and/or mitigation policy trends \n(medium confidence). However, such warming could occur in emissions \npathways consistent with policies implemented by the end of 2020 if \nclimate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best \nestimate (high confidence). {WGIII SPM C.1.3}\n112\t  Understanding of climate processes, the instrumental record, paleoclimates and model-based emergent constraints (see Annex I: Glossary). {WGI SPM footnote 21}\n113\t The best estimates [and very likely ranges] for the different scenarios are: 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8]°C (SSP1-1.9); 1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]°C (SSP1-2.6); 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C (SSP2-4.5); 3.6 [2.8 to 4.6]°C \n(SSP3-7.0); and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7]°C (SSP5-8.5). {WGI Table SPM.1} (Cross-Section Box.2)\n114\t In the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under \nthe intermediate and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely \nthan not to be reached under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). In all scenarios considered by WGI except the very high emissions scenario, the midpoint of the \nfirst 20-year running average period during which the assessed global warming reaches 1.5°C lies in the first half of the 2030s. In the very high GHG emissions scenario, this \nmid-point is in the late 2020s. The median five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered \nin WGIII is 2030–2035. {WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI Cross-Section Box TS.1, WGIII Table 3.2} (Cross-Section Box.2)\n115\t See Cross-Section Box.2.\n116\t Based on additional scenarios.\nGlobal warming will continue to increase in the near term in \nnearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Deep, \nrapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions, reaching net \nzero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions \nof other GHGs, in particular CH4, are necessary to limit warming \nto 1.5°C (>50%) or less than 2°C (>67%) by the end of century \n(high confidence). The best estimate of reaching 1.5°C of global \nwarming lies in the first half of the 2030s in most of the considered \nscenarios and modelled pathways114. In the very low GHG emissions \nscenario (SSP1-1.9), CO2 emissions reach net zero around 2050 and the \nbest-estimate end-of-century warming is 1.4°C, after a temporary overshoot \n(see Section 3.3.4) of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming. \nGlobal warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless \ndeep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming \ndecades. Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would \nlead to improvements in air quality within a few years, to reductions in \ntrends of global surface temperature discernible after around 20 years, \nand over longer time periods for many other climate impact-drivers115 \n(high confidence). Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead \nto more rapid improvements in air quality compared to reductions \nin GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are \nprojected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as \nwell as GHG emissions (high confidence)116. {WGI SPM B.1, WGI SPM B.1.3, \nWGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.2, WGI Figure SPM.4, WGI Table SPM.1, \nWGI Cross-Section Box TS.1; WGIII SPM C.3, WGIII Table SPM.2, \nWGIII Figure SPM.5, WGIII Box SPM.1 Figure 1, WGIII Table 3.2} (Table 3.1, \nCross-Section Box.2 Figure 1)\nChanges in short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) resulting from the \nfive considered scenarios lead to an additional net global warming \nin the near and long term (high confidence).

In high and very high GHG \nemissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes \nin SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a \nnet global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. \nThis is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, \ntropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution \ncontrol is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very \nlow GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution \ncontrol policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a \nnet cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead \nto a net warming (high confidence).

This is based upon recent evidence \nof observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new \nknowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural \nsystems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level \nof global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to \nmultiple times higher than currently observed (high confidence) for \n127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people \nand species. Risks, including cascading risks (see 3.1.3) and risks from \novershoot (see 3.3.4), are projected to become increasingly severe \nwith every increment of global warming (very high confidence). \n{WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII SPM B.4, WGII SPM B.5, WGII 16.6.3; SRCCL SPM A5.3} \n(Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3)\nClimate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for \nglobal warming of 1.5°C than at present (1.1°C) but lower than at 2°C \n(high confidence) (see Section 2.1.2). Climate-related risks to health, \nlivelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic \ngrowth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. In \nterrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species \nassessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. \nCoral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of \nglobal warming (high confidence). At this GWL, many low-elevation \nand small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or \ndisappear within decades to centuries (high confidence). Regions at \ndisproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, \nsmall island developing states and Least Developed Countries (high \nconfidence). {WGII SPM B.3, WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII TS.C.4.2; SR1.5 SPM A.3, \nSR1.5 SPM B.4.2, SR1.5 SPM B.5, SR1.5 SPM B.5.1} (Figure 3.3)\nAt 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal \ndistribution of impacts (RFC3), global aggregate impacts (RFC4) and \nlarge-scale singular events (RFC5) would be transitioning to high (medium \nconfidence), those associated with extreme weather events (RFC2) would \nbe transitioning to very high (medium confidence), and those associated \nwith unique and threatened systems (RFC1) would be very high (high \nconfidence) (Figure 3.3, panel a).

RFC1: Unique and \nthreatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive \nproperties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to \nhuman health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3: \nDistribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. \nRFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives affected, species lost \nor ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, \nsuch as ice sheet instability or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods include a structured expert elicitation based on the literature described in WGII SM16.6 \nand are identical to AR5 but are enhanced by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6.

WGII provides further assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems using these projections and additional lines of evidence. (a) Risks of species \nlosses as indicated by the percentage of assessed species exposed to potentially dangerous temperature conditions, as defined by conditions beyond the estimated historical \n(1850–2005) maximum mean annual temperature experienced by each species, at GWLs of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C. Underpinning projections of temperature are from 21 Earth \nsystem models and do not consider extreme events impacting ecosystems such as the Arctic. (b) Risk to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure \nto hypothermic conditions that pose a risk of mortality from surface air temperature and humidity conditions for historical period (1991–2005) and at GWLs of 1.7°C to 2.3°C \n(mean = 1.9°C; 13 climate models), 2.4°C to 3.1°C (2.7°C; 16 climate models) and 4.2°C to 5.4°C (4.7°C; 15 climate models). Interquartile ranges of WGLs by 2081–2100 \nunder RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The presented index is consistent with common features found in many indices included within WGI and WGII assessments. (c) Impacts \non food production: (c1) Changes in maize yield at projected GWLs of 1.6°C to 2.4°C (2.0°C), 3.3°C to 4.8°C (4.1°C) and 3.9°C to 6.0°C (4.9°C). Median yield changes \nfrom an ensemble of 12 crop models, each driven by bias-adjusted outputs from 5 Earth system models from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project \n(AgMIP) and the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). Maps depict 2080–2099 compared to 1986–2005 for current growing regions (>10 ha), with the \ncorresponding range of future global warming levels shown under SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. Hatching indicates areas where <70% of the climate-crop model \ncombinations agree on the sign of impact. (c2) Changes in maximum fisheries catch potential by 2081–2099 relative to 1986-2005 at projected GWLs of 0.9°C to 2.0°C (1.5°C) \nand 3.4°C to 5.2°C (4.3°C). GWLs by 2081–2100 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Hatching indicates where the two climate-fisheries models disagree in the direction of change. Large \nrelative changes in low yielding regions may correspond to small absolute changes. Biodiversity and fisheries in Antarctica were not analysed due to data limitations. Food security \nis also affected by crop and fishery failures not presented here. {WGII Fig. TS.5, WGII Fig TS.9, WGII Annex I: Global to Regional Atlas Figure AI.15, Figure AI.22, Figure AI.23, Figure \nAI.29; WGII 7.3.1.2, 7.2.4.1, SROCC Figure SPM.3} (3.1.2, Cross-Section Box.2)"

The burning embers result from a literature based \nexpert elicitation. Panel (a): Left - Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with \nobservational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity. Very likely ranges are shown for the low and high \nGHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0). Right - Global Reasons for Concern, comparing AR6 (thick embers) and AR5 (thin embers) assessments. Diagrams are shown for \neach RFC, assuming low to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localised and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very \nhigh-risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.1°C which is used to separate the observed, past \nimpacts below the line from the future projected risks above it. Lines connect the midpoints of the transition from moderate to high risk across AR5 and AR6. Panel (b): Risks for \nland-based systems and ocean/coastal ecosystems. Diagrams shown for each risk assume low to no adaptation. Text bubbles indicate examples of impacts at a given warming level. \nPanel (c): Left - Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. \nThe future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and \nlikely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Right - Assessment of the combined risk of coastal flooding, erosion and salinization for four illustrative coastal geographies in \n2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels, under two response scenarios, with respect to the SROCC baseline period (1986–2005) and indicating the IPCC AR6 baseline \nperiod (1995–2014). The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in \nextreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate response” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). \n“Maximum potential response” represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal \nfinancial, social and political barriers. The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), \ncoastal hazards (flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defences, ecosystem restoration or creation of new natural buffers areas, and \nsubsidence management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. The term \nresponse is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Panel (d): Left - Heat-sensitive human \nhealth outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under \nthree SSP scenarios. Right - Risks associated with food security due to climate change and patterns of socio-economic development. Risks to food security include availability and \naccess to food, including population at risk of hunger, food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed \nfor two contrasted socio-economic pathways (SSP1 and SSP3) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation and adaptation policies. Panel (e): Examples of regional key risks. Risks \nidentified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness of the consequences, degree of change, \nirreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); likelihood of adverse consequences; \ntemporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. {WGI Figure SPM.8; WGII SPM B.3.3, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII SM 16.6, WGII SM 16.7.4; \nSROCC Figure SPM.3d, SROCC SPM.5a, SROCC 4SM; SRCCL Figure SPM.2, SRCCL 7.3.1, SRCCL 7 SM} (Cross-Section Box.2)\n3.1.3 The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible \nChange\nThe likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts \nincrease with higher global warming levels (high confidence). \nAs warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or \nirreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests (medium \nconfidence), coral reefs (very high confidence) and in Arctic regions \n(high confidence). Risks associated with large-scale singular events \nor tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from \ntropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C (medium \nconfidence) and to very high risk between 2.5°C to  4°C (low confidence). \nThe response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations \ncan be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century \ntime scales (high confidence). The probability of crossing uncertain \nregional thresholds increases with further warming (high confidence). \n{WGI SPM C.3.2, WGI Box TS.9, WGI TS.2.6; WGII Figure SPM.3, \nWGII SPM B.3.1, WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII SPM B.5.2, WGII Table TS.1, \nWGII TS.C.1, WGII TS.C.13.3; SROCC SPM B.4}\nSea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due \nto continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and \nsea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years (high \nconfidence). Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st \ncentury (virtually certain), with projected regional relative sea level rise \nwithin 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline \n(medium confidence). The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold \nexceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend \non emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates \nof sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events \nthat occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur \nat least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 \n123\t This outcome is characterised by deep uncertainty: Its likelihood defies quantitative assessment but is considered due to its high potential impact. {WGI Box TS.1; \nWGII Cross-Chapter Box DEEP}\nand risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue \nto increase beyond 2100 (high confidence). At sustained warming \nlevels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice \nsheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple \nmillennia (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss \nincrease with higher global surface temperatures (high confidence). \nOver the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about \n2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C \n(low confidence). Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level \nrise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate \nperiods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today \nroughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to \n4°C higher than 1850–1900 (medium confidence). Further examples \nof unavoidable changes in the climate system due to multi-decadal \nor longer response timescales include continued glacier melt (very high \nconfidence) and permafrost carbon loss (high confidence). {WGI SPM B.5.2, \nWGI SPM B.5.3, WGI SPM B.5.4, WGI SPM C.2.5, WGI Box TS.4, \nWGI Box TS.9, WGI 9.5.1; WGII TS C.5; SROCC SPM B.3, SROCC SPM B.6, \nSROCC SPM B.9} (Figure 3.4)\nThe probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with \npotentially very large impacts increases with higher global \nwarming levels (high confidence). Warming substantially above the \nassessed very likely range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and \nthere is high confidence this would lead to regional changes greater \nthan assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, \nhigh-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming \nwithin the very likely assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. \nGlobal mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by \n2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions \nscenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be ruled out due to \ndeep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes123 and would have severe"

At higher levels \nof warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation \nlimits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. Maladaptation \ncan create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided by long-term planning and the \nimplementation of adaptation actions that are flexible, multi-sectoral and inclusive. (high confidence)\nThe effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented \nfor specific contexts, sectors and regions and will decrease with \nincreasing warming (high confidence)125. For example, common \nadaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and \nagronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop \nsystems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of \nwarming (high confidence). The effectiveness of most water-related \nadaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing \nwarming (high confidence). Adaptations for hydropower and \nthermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to \n1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming \n(medium confidence). Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to \nclimate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing \nglobal warming (high confidence). Globally, adaptation options related \nto agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, \nwith a substantial increase in residual risk (medium confidence). \n{WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.2.1, WGII SPM C.2.5, WGII SPM C.2.10, \nWGII Figure TS.6 Panel (e), 4.7.2} \nWith increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be \nreached and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the \npoorest vulnerable populations, will increase (high confidence). \nAlready below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation \nresponses by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will increasingly \nface hard limits (high confidence) (Section 2.1.2). Above 1.5°C, some \necosystem-based adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness \nin providing benefits to people as these ecosystems will reach hard \nadaptation limits (high confidence). Adaptation to address the risks of \nheat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work \nfor humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become \nsignificantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for \nregions with warm climates (high confidence). Above 1.5°C global \nwarming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits \nfor small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt \n124\t See Annex I: Glossary. Examples of compound extreme events are concurrent heatwaves and droughts or compound flooding. {WGI SPM Footnote 18}\n125\t There are limitations to assessing the full scope of adaptation options available in the future since not all possible future adaptation responses can be incorporated in climate \nimpact models, and projections of future adaptation depend on currently available technologies or approaches. {WGII 4.7.2}\n(medium confidence). By 2°C, soft limits are projected for multiple \nstaple crops, particularly in tropical regions (high confidence). By 3°C, \nsoft limits are projected for some water management measures for \nmany regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe (medium \nconfidence). {WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.3, WGII SPM C.3.4, WGII SPM C.3.5, \nWGII TS.D.2.2, WGII TS.D.2.3; SR1.5 SPM B.6; SROCC SPM C.1}\nIntegrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the \neffectiveness of adaptation. For example, inclusive, integrated \nand long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national \nscales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems \nand financial and technological resources and capabilities foster \nurban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting \nadaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning \nsystems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing that have \nbroad applicability across sectors and provide greater benefits to other \nadaptation options when combined. Transitioning from incremental to \ntransformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, \nprimarily in the financial, governance, institutional and policy domains, \ncan help overcome soft adaptation limits. However, adaptation does \nnot prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and \nbefore reaching soft and hard limits.

Panel (a): Global mean sea \nlevel change in metres relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 and for \n2150 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and median values and \nlikely ranges are shown for the considered scenarios. Relative to 1995-2014, the likely global mean sea level rise by 2050 is between 0.15 to 0.23 m in the very low \nGHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) and 0.20 to 0.29 m in the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); by 2100 between 0.28 to 0.55 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.63 to 1.01 m under \nSSP5-8.5; and by 2150 between 0.37 to 0.86 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.98 to 1.88 m under SSP5-8.5 (medium confidence). Changes relative to 1900 are calculated by adding 0.158 \nm (observed global mean sea level rise from 1900 to 1995-2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995-2014. The future changes to 2300 (bars) are based on literature assessment, \nrepresenting the 17th–83rd percentile range for SSP1-2.6 (0.3 to 3.1 m) and SSP5-8.5 (1.7 to 6.8 m). Red dashed lines: Low-likelihood, high-impact storyline, including ice sheet \ninstability processes. These indicate the potential impact of deeply uncertain processes, and show the 83rd percentile of SSP5-8.5 projections that include low-likelihood, high-\nimpact processes that cannot be ruled out; because of low confidence in projections of these processes, this is not part of a likely range.

Pathways consistent \nwith 1.5°C and 2°C carbon budgets imply rapid, deep, and in most cases immediate GHG emission reductions in \nall sectors (high confidence). Exceeding a warming level and returning (i.e. overshoot) implies increased risks \nand potential irreversible impacts; achieving and sustaining global net negative CO2 emissions would reduce \nwarming (high confidence).\n3.3.1 Remaining Carbon Budgets\nLimiting global temperature increase to a specific level requires \nlimiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to within a finite carbon \nbudget126, along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every \n1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises \nby likely 0.27°C to 0.63°C (best estimate of 0.45°C). This relationship \nimplies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in \norder to limit warming to any given level. {WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.1.1; \nSR1.5 SPM C.1.3} (Figure 3.5)\nThe best estimates of the remaining carbon budget (RCB) from \nthe beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% \nlikelihood127 is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C (67% likelihood) \nthis is 1150 GtCO2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified \nbased on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of \nhistorical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from \nthawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after \nglobal anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations \nin projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation \naction. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the \nresulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the \nsame level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting \nwarming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to \n600 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 warming129. Limiting warming to 2°C \nwith a 67% (or 83%) likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 (900) GtCO2 \nfrom the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, \nthe RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO2130. {WGI SPM D.1.2, WGI Table SPM.2; \nWGIII Box SPM.1, WGIII Box 3.4; SR1.5 SPM C.1.3}\n126\t See Annex I: Glossary. \n127\t This likelihood is based on the uncertainty in transient climate response to cumulative net CO2 emissions and additional Earth system feedbacks and provides the probability that \nglobal warming will not exceed the temperature levels specified. {WGI Table SPM.1}\n128\t Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Most countries report their anthropogenic \nland CO2 fluxes including fluxes due to human-caused environmental change (e.g., CO2 fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their National GHG inventories. Using emissions \nestimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {WGIII SPM Footnote 9, WGIII TS.3, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 6}\n129\t The central case RCB assumes future non-CO2 warming (the net additional contribution of aerosols and non-CO2 GHG) of around 0.1°C above 2010–2019 in line with stringent \nmitigation scenarios. If additional non-CO2 warming is higher, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood shrinks to around 300 GtCO2. If, however, additional \nnon-CO2 warming is limited to only 0.05°C (via stronger reductions of CH4 and N2O through a combination of deep structural and behavioural changes, e.g., dietary changes), \nthe RCB could be around 600 GtCO2 for 1.5°C warming. {WGI Table SPM.2, WGI Box TS.7; WGIII Box 3.4}\n130\t When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, these RCB estimates are similar to SR1.5 but larger than AR5 values due to methodological improvements. {WGI SPM D.1.3}\n131\t Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the specific calculated fractions. \n132\t See footnote 131. \n133\t These projected adjustments of carbon sinks to stabilisation or decline of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are accounted for in calculations of remaining carbon budgets. \n{WGI SPM footnote 32}\nIf the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, \nat the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would \nalmost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and \nexhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C \n(67%) (Figure 3.5). Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative \nnet CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 (2400 ±240 GtCO2) amount \nto about four-fifths131 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of \nlimiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO2) and \nto about two-thirds132 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability \nto limit global warming to 2°C (central estimate about 3550 GtCO2). \n{WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Table 2.1}\nIn scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the land and ocean \ncarbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the \naccumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence). While \nnatural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute \nterms, a progressively larger amount of CO2 under higher compared to \nlower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the \nproportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with \nincreasing cumulative net CO2 emissions (high confidence). Additional \necosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, \nsuch as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, \nwould further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere \n(high confidence). In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and \ndecline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less \ncarbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations (high \nconfidence) and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low \nGHG emissions scenario (medium confidence)133. {WGI SPM B.4, \nWGI SPM B.4.1, WGI SPM B.4.2, WGI SPM B.4.3}"

Achieving global net zero \nCO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO2 emissions balanced by \ndurably stored CO2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to \nstabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase (see 3.3.3) \n(high confidence). This is different from achieving net zero GHG \nemissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions (see \nCross-Section Box.1) equal CO2 removal (high confidence). Emissions \npathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the \n100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions \nand are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature \nafter an earlier peak (high confidence). While reaching net zero CO2 or net \nzero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross \nemissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hard-\nto-abate residual emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, \naviation, shipping, and industrial processes) is unavoidable (high \nconfidence). {WGI SPM D.1, WGI SPM D.1.1, WGI SPM D.1.8; WGIII SPM C.2, \nWGIII SPM C.3, WGIII SPM C.11, WGIII Box TS.6; SR1.5 SPM A.2.2}\nIn modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, \nfollowed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several \nvariables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation \nstrategy and the gases covered (high confidence). Global net zero \nCO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit \nwarming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, and around \nthe early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%). While \nnon-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit \nwarming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O \nand F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2-eq yr-1 remain at the time of \n134\t Net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential.

Negative values (e.g., in C5, C6) represent \nan increase in emissions. The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55 [53–58] GtCO2-eq, thus within the uncertainty ranges of estimates for 2019 emissions [53-66] GtCO2-eq \n(see 2.1.1). \n4 Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year time-step data of the modelled pathways. Ranges in square \nbrackets underneath refer to the range across the pathways, comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile 5-year interval and the upper bound of the 95th percentile \n5-year interval. Numbers in round brackets signify the fraction of pathways that reach specific milestones over the 21st century. Percentiles reported across all pathways in \nthat category include those that do not reach net zero before 2100.\n5 For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and aggregated into a Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO2-eq defined by the 100-year \nglobal warming potential. For each pathway, reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions was the minimum required for the assessment of the climate response and the assignment \nto a climate category. Emissions pathways without climate assessment are not included in the ranges presented here. See WGIII Annex III.II.5. \n6 Cumulative emissions are calculated from the start of 2020 to the time of net zero and 2100, respectively. They are based on harmonised net CO2 emissions, ensuring \nconsistency with the WG I assessment of the remaining carbon budget. {WGIII Box 3.4, WGIII SPM Footnote 50}"

Reductions \nin GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas \ncan be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and \nconservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy \ncarriers (see also 4.5, Figure 4.4). Socio-cultural options and behavioural \nchange can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most \nof the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved \n136\t CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO2 is captured directly from the \natmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for \ngas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it \nis a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which is more than the CO2 storage requirements through \n2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and \nmanaged, it is estimated that the CO2 can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological \nenvironmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. Enabling \nconditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers.

Panel (a) presents selected mitigation and adaptation options across different systems. The left hand side \nof panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As \nliterature above 1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. The term response is used here in addition to \nadaptation because some responses, such as migration, relocation and resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, \nallows reduction of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation \nand afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) were used \nto calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the \nfigure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and low. The right-hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected \nmitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the longer term compared to 2030. Costs \nare net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net \nGHG emission reduction that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a specified emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions are the sum of reduced emissions \nand/or enhanced sinks. The baseline used consists of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25–75 percentile values). The mitigation \npotentials are assessed independently for each option and are not necessarily additive. Health system mitigation options are included mostly in settlement and infrastructure \n(e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. The length \nof the solid bars represents the mitigation potential of an option. Potentials are broken down into cost categories, indicated by different colours (see legend). Only discounted lifetime \nmonetary costs are considered. Where a gradual colour transition is shown, the breakdown of the potential into cost categories is not well known or depends heavily on factors such \nas geographical location, resource availability, and regional circumstances, and the colours indicate the range of estimates. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. \nWhen interpreting this figure, the following should be taken into account: (1) The mitigation potential is uncertain, as it will depend on the reference technology (and emissions) \nbeing displaced, the rate of new technology adoption, and several other factors; (2) Different options have different feasibilities beyond the cost aspects, which are not reflected in \nthe figure; and (3) Costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until 2030, and are not included. \nPanel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all \nglobal regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced \nby national governments until 2020. The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying \nthe highest and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use patterns \nenabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, \nfood) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-\nside mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due \nto increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, this projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation \noptions in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural factors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow). {WGII Figure SPM.4, \nWGII Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18; WGIII SPM C.10, WGIII 12.2.1, WGIII 12.2.2, WGIII Figure SPM.6, WGIII Figure SPM.7}\n4.5.1.

A more comprehensive, \nharmonised set of definitions for terms used in this SYR and the \nthree AR6 Working Group reports is available from the IPCC \nOnline Glossary: https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/\nReaders are requested to refer to this comprehensive online \nglossary for definitions of terms of a more technical nature, and \nfor scientific references relevant to individual terms. Italicized \nwords indicate that the term is defined in this or/and the online \nglossary. Subterms appear in italics beneath main terms. \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \nA UN resolution in September 2015 aadopting a plan of action for \npeople, planet and prosperity in a new global development framework \nanchored in 17 Sustainable Development Goals. \n \nAbrupt climate change\nA large-scale abrupt change in the climate system that takes place over \na few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least \na few decades and causes substantial impacts in human and/or natural \nsystems. See also: Abrupt change, Tipping point.\nAdaptation\nIn human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected \nclimate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial \nopportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual \nclimate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment \nto expected climate and its effects. See also: Adaptation options, \nAdaptive capacity, Maladaptive actions (Maladaptation). \nAdaptation gap \nThe difference between actually implemented adaptation and a \nsocietally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to \ntolerated climate change impacts and reflecting resource limitations \nand competing priorities. \n \nAdaptation limits \nThe point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be \nsecured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. \n•\t  Hard adaptation limit - No adaptive actions are possible to \navoid intolerable risks. \n•\t  Soft adaptation limit - Options may exist but are currently \nnot available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive \naction.\n \nTransformational adaptation \nAdaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a \nsocial-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and \nits impacts. \nAerosol\nA suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with typical particle \nsize in the range of a few nanometres to several tens of micrometres \nand atmospheric lifetimes of up to several days in the troposphere \nand up to years in the stratosphere. The term aerosol, which includes \nboth the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report \nin its plural form to mean ‘aerosol particles’. Aerosols may be of either \nnatural or anthropogenic origin in the troposphere; stratospheric \naerosols mostly stem from volcanic eruptions. Aerosols can cause an \neffective radiative forcing directly through scattering and absorbing \nradiation (aerosol–radiation interaction), and indirectly by acting as \ncloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles that affect the \nproperties of clouds (aerosol–cloud interaction), and upon deposition \non snow- or ice-covered surfaces. Atmospheric aerosols may be either \nemitted as primary particulate matter or formed within the atmosphere \nfrom gaseous precursors (secondary production). Aerosols may be \ncomposed of sea salt, organic carbon, black carbon (BC), mineral \nspecies (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate and ammonium or \ntheir mixtures. See also: Particulate matter (PM), Aerosol–radiation \ninteraction, Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). \nAfforestation \nConversion to forest of land that historically has not contained forests. \nSee also: Anthropogenic removals, Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), \nDeforestation, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest \nDegradation (REDD+), Reforestation.\n[Note: For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as \nafforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the 2006 IPCC \nGuidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and their \n2019 Refinement, and information provided by the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change] \nAgricultural drought\nSee: Drought.\n \nAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nIn the context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under \nthe United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \nAFOLU is the sum of the GHG inventory sectors Agriculture and \nLand Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF); see the 2006 \nIPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories for details. Given the \ndifference in estimating the ‘anthropogenic’ carbon dioxide (CO2) \nremovals between countries and the global modelling community, the \nland-related net GHG emissions from global models included in this \nreport are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates \nin national GHG Inventories. See also: Land use, land-use change and \nforestry (LULUCF), Land-use change (LUC).  \nAgroforestry\nCollective name for land-use systems and technologies where woody \nperennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used \non the same land-management units as agricultural crops and/or \nanimals, in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence. \nIn agroforestry systems there are both ecological and economical \ninteractions between the different components. Agroforestry can \nalso be defined as a dynamic, ecologically based, natural resource \nmanagement system that, through the integration of trees on farms"

See also: Ecosystem, Ecosystem services.\n  \nBioenergy \nEnergy derived from any form of biomass or its metabolic by-products. \nSee also: Biofuel.\n \nBioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)\nCarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology applied to \na bioenergy facility. Note that, depending on the total emissions \nof the BECCS supply chain, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be removed \nfrom the atmosphere. See also: Anthropogenic removals, \nCarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), Carbon dioxide removal (CDR).\nBlue carbon \nBiologically-driven carbon fluxes and storage in marine systems that \nare amenable to management. Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted \nvegetation in the coastal zone, such as tidal marshes, mangroves and \nseagrasses. These ecosystems have high carbon burial rates on a per \nunit area basis and accumulate carbon in their soils and sediments. \nThey provide many non-climatic benefits and can contribute to \necosystem-based adaptation. If degraded or lost, coastal blue carbon \necosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back to the \natmosphere. There is current debate regarding the application of the \nblue carbon concept to other coastal and non-coastal processes and \necosystems, including the open ocean. See also: Ecosystem services, \nSequestration.\nBlue infrastructure\nSee: Infrastructure.\n  \nCarbon budget \nRefers to two concepts in the literature:  \n(1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level, \nthrough the synthesis of evidence for fossil fuel and cement emissions, \nemissions and removals associated with land use and land-use change, \nocean and natural land sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), \nand the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This is \nreferred to as the Global Carbon Budget; (2) the maximum amount of \ncumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions that would result in \nlimiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking \ninto account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is \nreferred to as the Total Carbon Budget when expressed starting from \nthe pre-industrial period, and as the Remaining Carbon Budget when \nexpressed from a recent specified date.\n[Note 1: Net anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anthropogenic \nCO2 emissions minus anthropogenic CO2 removals. See also: \nCarbon Dioxide Removal (CDR).  \nNote 2: The maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic \nCO2 emissions is reached at the time that annual net anthropogenic \nCO2 emissions reach zero. \nNote 3: The degree to which anthropogenic climate forcers other than \nCO2 affect the total carbon budget and remaining carbon budget \ndepends on human choices about the extent to which these forcers are \nmitigated and their resulting climate effects. \nNote 4: The notions of a total carbon budget and remaining carbon \nbudget are also being applied in parts of the scientific literature \nand by some entities at regional, national, or sub-national level. The \ndistribution of global budgets across individual different entities and \nemitters depends strongly on considerations of equity and other value \njudgements.] \nCarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) \nA process in which a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) \nfrom industrial and energy-related sources is separated (captured), \nconditioned, compressed and transported to a storage location for \nlong-term isolation from the atmosphere. Sometimes referred to as \nCarbon Capture and Storage. See also: Anthropogenic removals, \nBioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS), \nCarbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU), Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), \nSequestration.\nCarbon dioxide removal (CDR) \nAnthropogenic activities removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the \natmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or \nocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential \nanthropogenic enhancement of biological or geochemical CO2 sinks \nand direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage (DACCS) but excludes \nnatural CO2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. \nSee also: Afforestation, Anthropogenic removals, Biochar, Bioenergy \nwith carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS), Carbon dioxide \ncapture and storage (CCS), Enhanced weathering, Ocean alkalinization/\nOcean alkalinity enhancement, Reforestation, Soil carbon sequestration (SCS).\n \nCascading impacts\nCascading impacts from extreme weather/climate events occur when \nan extreme hazard generates a sequence of secondary events in natural \nand human systems that result in physical, natural, social or economic \ndisruption, whereby the resulting impact is significantly larger than the \ninitial impact. Cascading impacts are complex and multi-dimensional, \nand are associated more with the magnitude of vulnerability than with \nthat of the hazard.\nClimate \nIn a narrow sense, climate is usually defined as the average weather \n-or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean \nand variability of relevant quantities- over a period of time ranging \nfrom months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period \nfor averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World"

The relevant quantities are most \noften surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. \nClimate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, \nof the climate system. \n \nClimate change \nA change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using \nstatistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its \nproperties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades \nor longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes \nor external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic \neruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of \nthe atmosphere or in land use. See also: Climate variability, Detection \nand attribution, Global warming, Natural (climate) variability, Ocean \nacidification (OA).\n[Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change \nof climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity \nthat alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in \naddition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time \nperiods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change \nattributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition \nand climate variability attributable to natural causes.]\nClimate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) \nThe occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above \n(or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range \nof observed values of the variable. By definition, the characteristics of \nwhat is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an \nabsolute sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some \ntime, such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme climate event, \nespecially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high \ntemperature, drought, or heavy rainfall over a season). For simplicity, \nboth extreme weather events and extreme climate events are referred \nto collectively as ‘climate extremes’. \nClimate finance \nThere is no agreed definition of climate finance. The term ‘climate \nfinance’ is applied to the financial resources devoted to addressing \nclimate change by all public and private actors from global to local \nscales, including international financial flows to developing countries \nto assist them in addressing climate change. Climate finance aims to \nreduce net greenhouse gas emissions and/or to enhance adaptation \nand increase resilience to the impacts of current and projected climate \nchange. Finance can come from private and public sources, channelled \nby various intermediaries, and is delivered by a range of instruments, \nincluding grants, concessional and non-concessional debt, and internal \nbudget reallocations. \n \nClimate governance   \nThe structures, processes, and actions through which private and public \nactors seek to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nClimate justice\nSee: Justice.\nClimate literacy \nClimate literacy encompasses being aware of climate change, its \nanthropogenic causes, and implications. \n \nClimate resilient development (CRD) \nClimate-resilient development refers to the process of implementing \ngreenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support \nsustainable development for all. \n  \nClimate sensitivity \nThe change in the surface temperature in response to a change in the \natmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration or other radiative \nforcing. See also: Climate feedback parameter. \n \nEquilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)  \nThe equilibrium (steady state) change in the surface temperature \nfollowing a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) \nconcentration from pre-industrial conditions.  \nClimate services \nClimate services involve the provision of climate information in such \na way as to assist decision-making. The service includes appropriate \nengagement from users and providers, is based on scientifically credible \ninformation and expertise, has an effective access mechanism, and \nresponds to user needs. \n \nClimate system \nThe global system consisting of five major components: the atmosphere, \nthe hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere, \nand the interactions between them. The climate system changes in \ntime under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because of \nexternal forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, orbital \nforcing, and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition \nof the atmosphere and land-use change. \n  \nClimatic impact-driver (CID)\nPhysical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) \nthat affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system \ntolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral \nor a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. \nSee also: Hazard, Impacts, Risk.\nCO2-equivalent emission (CO2-eq)\nThe amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission that would have an \nequivalent effect on a specified key measure of climate change, over \na specified time horizon, as an emitted amount of another greenhouse \ngas (GHG) or a mixture of other GHGs. For a mix of GHGs it is obtained \nby summing the CO2-equivalent emissions of each gas. There are \nvarious ways and time horizons to compute such equivalent emissions \n(see greenhouse gas emission metric). CO2-equivalent emissions are \ncommonly used to compare emissions of different GHGs but should not \nbe taken to imply that these emissions have an equivalent effect across \nall key measures of climate change.\n[Note: Under the Paris Rulebook [Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph \n37], parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or \nGWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report"

See also: Afforestation, \nReforestation, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest \nDegradation (REDD+).\n[Note: For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such \nas afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the 2006 \nIPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and their \n2019 Refinement, and information provided by the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change]\n \nDemand-side measures \nPolicies and programmes for influencing the demand for goods and/ or \nservices. In the energy sector, demand-side mitigation measures aim at \nreducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions emitted per unit of \nenergy service used.\n  \nDeveloped / developing countries (Industrialissed / developed / \ndeveloping countries) \nThere is a diversity of approaches for categorizing countries on the \nbasis of their level of development, and for defining terms such as \nindustrialised, developed, or developing. Several categorisations \nare used in this report. (1) In the United Nations (UN) system, there \nis no established convention for the designation of developed and \ndeveloping countries or areas. (2) The UN Statistics Division specifies \ndeveloped and developing regions based on common practice. In \naddition, specific countries are designated as least developed countries, \nlandlocked developing countries, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), \nand transition economies. Many countries appear in more than one of \nthese categories. (3) The World Bank uses income as the main criterion \nfor classifying countries as low, lower middle, upper middle, and high \nincome. (4) The UN Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates \nindicators for life expectancy, educational attainment, and income \ninto a single composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify \ncountries as low, medium, high, or very high human development.  \nDevelopment pathways\nSee: Pathways.\n \nDisaster risk management (DRM) \nProcesses for designing, implementing and evaluating strategies, \npolicies and measures to improve the understanding of current and \nfuture disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and \npromote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, prevention \nand protection, response and recovery practices, with the explicit \npurpose of increasing human security, well-being, quality of life and \nsustainable development (SD). \nDisplacement (of humans) \nThe involuntary movement, individually or collectively, of persons \nfrom their country or community, notably for reasons of armed conflict, \ncivil unrest, or natural or human-made disasters. \n \nDrought \nAn exceptional period of water shortage for existing ecosystems and the \nhuman population (due to low rainfall, high temperature and/or wind). \nSee also: Plant evaporative stress.\n \nAgricultural and ecological drought \nDepending on the affected biome: a period with abnormal \nsoil moisture deficit, which results from combined shortage of \nprecipitation and excess evapotranspiration, and during the growing \nseason impinges on crop production or ecosystem function in \ngeneral.\n \nEarly warning systems (EWS) \nThe set of technical and institutional capacities to forecast, predict, and \ncommunicate timely and meaningful warning information to enable \nindividuals, communities, managed ecosystems, and organisations \nthreatened by a hazard to prepare to act promptly and appropriately \nto reduce the possibility of harm or loss. Depending upon context, EWS \nmay draw upon scientific and/or Indigenous knowledge, and other \nknowledge types. EWS are also considered for ecological applications, \ne.g., conservation, where the organisation itself is not threatened by \nhazard but the ecosystem under conservation is (e.g., coral bleaching alerts), \nin agriculture (e.g., warnings of heavy rainfall, drought, ground frost, \nand hailstorms) and in fisheries (e.g., warnings of storm, storm surge, \nand tsunamis). \nEcological drought\nSee: Drought.\nEcosystem \nAn ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, \ntheir nonliving environment and the interactions within and between \nthem. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial \nboundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined: \nin some cases, they are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse. \nEcosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems are nested \nwithin other ecosystems and their scale can range from very small to \nthe entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain \npeople as key organisms, or are influenced by the effects of human \nactivities in their environment. See also: Ecosystem health, Ecosystem \nservices. \nEcosystem-based adaptation (EbA) \nThe use of ecosystem management activities to increase the \nresilience and reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to \nclimate change. See also: Adaptation, Nature-based solution (NbS).\nEcosystem services \nEcological processes or functions having monetary or non-monetary \nvalue to individuals or society at large.

Enabling conditions include finance, technological innovation, \nstrengthening policy instruments, institutional capacity, multi-level \ngovernance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles. \nEquality \nA principle that ascribes equal worth to all human beings, including \nequal opportunities, rights and obligations, irrespective of origins. \nSee also: Equity, Fairness.\n\t\n\t\nInequality \nUneven opportunities and social positions, and processes of \ndiscrimination within a group or society, based on gender, \nclass, ethnicity, age, and (dis)ability, often produced by uneven \ndevelopment. Income inequality refers to gaps between highest and \nlowest income earners within a country and between countries. \nEquilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)\nSee: Climate sensitivity.\nEquity  \nThe principle of being fair and impartial, and a basis for understanding \nhow the impacts and responses to climate change, including costs and \nbenefits, are distributed in and by society in more or less equal ways. \nOften aligned with ideas of equality, fairness and justice and applied \nwith respect to equity in the responsibility for, and distribution of, \nclimate impacts and policies across society, generations, and gender, \nand in the sense of who participates and controls the processes of \ndecision-making.  \n \nExposure  \nThe presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental \nfunctions, services, and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social, or \ncultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected. \nSee also: Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts, Risk.\n \nFeasibility  \nIn this report, feasibility refers to the potential for a mitigation or \nadaptation option to be implemented. Factors influencing feasibility \nare context-dependent, temporally dynamic, and may vary between \ndifferent groups and actors. Feasibility depends on geophysical, \nenvironmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and \ninstitutional factors that enable or constrain the implementation of an \noption. The feasibility of options may change when different options \nare combined and increase when enabling conditions are strengthened. \nSee also: Enabling conditions (for adaptation and mitigation options).\nFire weather \nWeather conditions conducive to triggering and sustaining wildfires, \nusually based on a set of indicators and combinations of indicators \nincluding temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and wind. Fire weather \ndoes not include the presence or absence of fuel load. \n \nFood loss and waste \nThe decrease in quantity or quality of food. Food waste is part of food \nloss and refers to discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that \nis safe and nutritious for human consumption along the entire food \nsupply chain, from primary production to end household consumer \nlevel. Food waste is recognized as a distinct part of food loss because \nthe drivers that generate it and the solutions to it are different from \nthose of food losses. \n \nFood security \nA situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social \nand economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets \ntheir dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. \nThe four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization and \nstability. The nutritional dimension is integral to the concept of food \nsecurity. \nGlobal warming \nGlobal warming refers to the increase in global surface temperature \nrelative to a baseline reference period, averaging over a period \nsufficient to remove interannual variations (e.g., 20 or 30 years). A \ncommon choice for the baseline is 1850–1900 (the earliest period \nof reliable observations with sufficient geographic coverage), with \nmore modern baselines used depending upon the application. \nSee also: Climate change, Climate variability, Natural (climate) \nvariability.\n \nGlobal warming potential (GWP) \nAn index measuring the radiative forcing following an emission of a unit \nmass of a given substance, accumulated over a chosen time horizon, \nrelative to that of the reference substance, carbon dioxide (CO2). The \nGWP thus represents the combined effect of the differing times these \nsubstances remain in the atmosphere and their effectiveness in causing \nradiative forcing.

This property causes the greenhouse \neffect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), \nmethane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary GHGs in the Earth’s \natmosphere. Human-made GHGs include sulphur hexafluoride \n(SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and \nperfluorocarbons (PFCs); several of these are also O3-depleting \n(and are regulated under the Montreal Protocol).

They form \nat present principally non-dominant sectors of society and are often \ndetermined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations \ntheir ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their \ncontinued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural \npatterns, social institutions, and common law system. \n   \nInformal settlement \nA term given to settlements or residential areas that by at least one \ncriterion fall outside official rules and regulations. Most informal \nsettlements have poor housing (with widespread use of temporary \nmaterials) and are developed on land that is occupied illegally with \nhigh levels of overcrowding. In most such settlements, provision for safe \nwater, sanitation, drainage, paved roads, and basic services is inadequate \nor lacking. The term ‘slum’ is often used for informal settlements, \nalthough it is misleading as many informal settlements develop into \ngood quality residential areas, especially where governments support \nsuch development. \n \nInfrastructure  \nThe designed and built set of physical systems and corresponding \ninstitutional arrangements that mediate between people, their \ncommunities, and the broader environment to provide services that \nsupport economic growth, health, quality of life, and safety.  \nBlue infrastructure   \nBlue infrastructure includes bodies of water, watercourses, ponds, \nlakes and storm drainage, that provide ecological and hydrological \nfunctions including evaporation, transpiration, drainage, infiltration, \nand temporary storage of runoff and discharge.  \n  \nGreen infrastructure   \nThe strategically planned interconnected set of natural and \nconstructed ecological systems, green spaces and other landscape \nfeatures that can provide functions and services including air \nand water purification, temperature management, floodwater \nmanagement and coastal defence often with co-benefits for \npeople and biodiversity.

Since managed land may include carbon \ndioxide (CO2) removals not considered as ‘anthropogenic’ in some of the \nscientific literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with \nCO2 fertilisation and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission \nestimates from global models included in this report are not necessarily \ndirectly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories \n(IPCC 2006, 2019). \n \nLeast Developed Countries (LDCs) \nA list of countries designated by the Economic and Social Council of the \nUnited Nations (ECOSOC) as meeting three criteria: (1) a low income \ncriterion below a certain threshold of gross national income per capita \nof between USD 750 and USD 900, (2) a human resource weakness \nbased on indicators of health, education, adult literacy, and (3) an \neconomic vulnerability weakness based on indicators on instability \nof agricultural production, instability of export of goods and services, \neconomic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export \nconcentration, and the handicap of economic smallness. Countries in this \ncategory are eligible for a number of programmes focused on assisting \ncountries most in need. These privileges include certain benefits under \nthe articles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC).  \n \nLivelihood \nThe resources used and the activities undertaken in order for people to \nlive. Livelihoods are usually determined by the entitlements and assets \nto which people have access. Such assets can be categorised as human, \nsocial, natural, physical or financial. \n \nLocal knowledge (LK) \nThe understandings and skills developed by individuals and \npopulations, specific to the places where they live. Local knowledge \ninforms decision-making about fundamental aspects of life, from \nday-to-day activities to longer term actions. This knowledge is a \nkey element of the social and cultural systems which influence \nobservations of and responses to climate change; it also informs \ngovernance decisions. See also: Indigenous knowledge (IK). \n \nLock-in \nA situation in which the future development of a system, including \ninfrastructure, technologies, investments, institutions, and behavioural \nnorms, is determined or constrained (‘locked in’) by historic developments. \nSee also: Path dependence.\n \nLoss and Damage, and losses and damages \nResearch has taken Loss and Damage (capitalised letters) to refer to \npolitical debate under the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC) following the establishment of the Warsaw \nMechanism on Loss and Damage in 2013, which is to ‘address loss \nand damage associated with impacts of climate change, including \nextreme events and slow onset events, in developing countries that \nare particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.’ \nLowercase letters (losses and damages) have been taken to refer \nbroadly to harm from (observed) impacts and (projected) risks and can \nbe economic or non-economic. \nLow-likelihood, high-impact outcomes \nOutcomes/events whose probability of occurrence is low or not well \nknown (as in the context of deep uncertainty) but whose potential \nimpacts on society and ecosystems could be high. To better inform risk \nassessment and decision-making, such low-likelihood outcomes are \nconsidered if they are associated with very large consequences and may \ntherefore constitute material risks, even though those consequences do \nnot necessarily represent the most likely outcome. See also: Impacts. \n \nMaladaptive actions (Maladaptation) \nActions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related \noutcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nincreased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable \noutcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, \nmaladaptation is an unintended consequence. \n  \nMigration (of humans) \nMovement of a person or a group of persons, either across an \ninternational border, or within a State. It is a population movement, \nencompassing any kind of movement of people, whatever its length, \ncomposition and causes; it includes migration of refugees, displaced \npersons, economic migrants, and persons moving for other purposes, \nincluding family reunification. \n \nMitigation (of climate change) \nA human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of \ngreenhouse gases.  \n \nMitigation potential \nThe quantity of net greenhouse gas emission reductions that can be \nachieved by a given mitigation option relative to specified emission \nbaselines. See also: Sequestration potential.\n[Note: Net greenhouse gas emission reductions is the sum of reduced \nemissions and/or enhanced sinks]\nNatural (climate) variability \nNatural variability refers to climatic fluctuations that occur without \nany human influence, that is internal variability combined with the \nresponse to external natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, \nchanges in solar activity and, on longer time-scales, orbital effects and \nplate tectonics. See also: Orbital forcing.\nNet zero CO2 emissions \nCondition in which anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions \nare balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified period. \nSee also: Carbon neutrality, Land use, land-use change and forestry \n(LULUCF), Net zero greenhouse gas emissions. \n[Note: Carbon neutrality and net zero CO2 emissions are overlapping \nconcepts. The concepts can be applied at global or sub-global \nscales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national). At a global \nscale, the terms carbon neutrality and net zero CO2 emissions are \nequivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero CO2 emissions is generally \napplied to emissions and removals under direct control or territorial \nresponsibility of the reporting entity, while carbon neutrality generally \nincludes emissions and removals within and beyond the direct control"

The quantification of net zero \nGHG emissions depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare \nemissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon \nchosen for that metric. See also: Greenhouse gas neutrality, Land use, \nland-use change and forestry (LULUCF), Net zero CO2 emissions.\n[Note 1: Greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero GHG emissions are \noverlapping concepts. The concept of net zero GHG emissions can \nbe applied at global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national \nand sub-national). At a global scale, the terms GHG neutrality and \nnet zero GHG emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net \nzero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals \nunder direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, \nwhile GHG neutrality generally includes anthropogenic emissions \nand anthropogenic removals within and beyond the direct control \nor territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. Accounting rules \nspecified by GHG programmes or schemes can have a significant \ninfluence on the quantification of relevant emissions and removals.\nNote 2: Under the Paris Rulebook (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph \n37), parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or \nGWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report \naggregate emissions and removals of GHGs. In addition, parties may \nuse other metrics to report supplemental information on aggregate \nemissions and removals of GHGs.]\nNew Urban Agenda \nThe New Urban Agenda was adopted at the United Nations Conference \non Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in Quito, \nEcuador, on 20 October 2016. It was endorsed by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth plenary meeting of the seventy-first session \non 23 December 2016. \nOvershoot pathways\nSee: Pathways.\n  \nPathways \nThe temporal evolution of natural and/or human systems towards \na future state. Pathway concepts range from sets of quantitative \nand qualitative scenarios or narratives of potential futures to \nsolution-oriented decision-making processes to achieve desirable \nsocietal goals. Pathway approaches typically focus on biophysical, \ntechno-economic and/or socio-behavioural trajectories and involve \nvarious dynamics, goals and actors across different scales. See also: \nScenario, Storyline. \n \nDevelopment pathways \nDevelopment pathways evolve as the result of the countless \ndecisions being made and actions being taken at all levels of societal \nstructure, as well due to the emergent dynamics within and between \ninstitutions, cultural norms, technological systems and other drivers \nof behavioural change. See also: Shifting development pathways \n(SDPs), Shifting development pathways to sustainability (SDPS). \nEmission pathways \nModelled trajectories of global anthropogenic emissions over \nthe 21st century are termed emission pathways. \n \nOvershoot pathways \nPathways that first exceed a specified concentration, forcing or \nglobal warming level, and then return to or below that level again \nbefore the end of a specified period of time (e.g., before 2100). \nSometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot are also \ncharacterised. The overshoot duration can vary from one pathway \nto the next, but in most overshoot pathways in the literature and \nreferred to as overshoot pathways in the AR6, the overshoot occurs \nover a period of at least one decade and up to several decades. \nSee also: Temperature overshoot.\n \nShared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) \nShared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) have been developed to \ncomplement the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). By \ndesign, the RCP emission and concentration pathways were stripped \nof their association with a certain socio-economic development. \nDifferent levels of emissions and climate change along the \ndimension of the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop \nof different socio-economic development pathways (SSPs) on the \nother dimension in a matrix. This integrative SSP-RCP framework is \nnow widely used in the climate impact and policy analysis literature \n(see, e.g., http://iconics-ssp.org), where climate projections obtained \nunder the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of \nvarious SSPs. As several emission updates were due, a new set of \nemission scenarios was developed in conjunction with the SSPs. \nHence, the abbreviation SSP is now used for two things: On the one \nhand SSP1, SSP2, …, SSP5 is used to denote the five socio-economic \nscenario families. On the other hand, the abbreviations SSP1-1.9, \nSSP1-2.6, …, SSP5-8.5 are used to denote the newly developed \nemission scenarios that are the result of an SSP implementation \nwithin an integrated assessment model. Those SSP scenarios are \nbare of climate policy assumption, but in combination with so-called \nshared policy assumptions (SPAs), various approximate radiative \nforcing levels of 1.9, 2.6, …, or 8.5 W m−2 are reached by the \nend of the century, respectively. denote trajectories that address \nsocial, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment, adaptation and mitigation, and transformation, in a \ngeneric sense or from a particular methodological perspective such \nas integrated assessment models and scenario simulations. \n \nPlanetary health \nA concept based on the understanding that human health and human \ncivilisation depend on ecosystem health and the wise stewardship of \necosystems. \n  \nReasons for concern (RFCs) \nElements of a classification framework, first developed in the IPCC Third \nAssessment Report, which aims to facilitate judgements about what \nlevel of climate change may be dangerous (in the language of Article \n2 of the UNFCCC; UNFCCC, 1992) by aggregating risks from various \nsectors, considering hazards, exposures, vulnerabilities, capacities to \nadapt, and the resulting impacts."

Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains capacity \nfor adaptation, learning and/or transformation. See also: Hazard, Risk, \nVulnerability. \n \nRestoration \nIn the environmental context, restoration involves human interventions \nto assist the recovery of an ecosystem that has been previously \ndegraded, damaged or destroyed. \n \nRisk \nThe potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological \nsystems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated \nwith such systems. In the context of climate change, risks can arise from \npotential impacts of climate change as well as human responses to \nclimate change. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, \nlivelihoods, health and well-being, economic, social and cultural assets \nand investments, infrastructure, services (including ecosystem services), \necosystems and species. \nIn the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic \ninteractions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and \nvulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to the hazards. \nHazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty \nin terms of magnitude and likelihood of occurrence, and each may \nchange over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human \ndecision-making. \nIn the context of climate change responses, risks result from the \npotential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s), or \nfrom potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other societal \nobjectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Risks can \narise for example from uncertainty in the implementation, effectiveness \nor outcomes of climate policy, climate-related investments, technology \ndevelopment or adoption, and system transitions. \nSee also: Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts, Risk management, \nAdaptation, Mitigation. \nKey risk \nKey risks have potentially severe adverse consequences for humans \nand social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of \nclimate related hazards with vulnerabilities of societies and systems \nexposed. \nScenario \nA plausible description of how the future may develop based on a \ncoherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving \nforces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships. \nNote that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts but are used \nto provide a view of the implications of developments and actions. \nSee also: Scenario, Scenario storyline.\n \nEmission scenario \nA plausible representation of the future development of emissions \nof substances that are radiatively active (e.g., greenhouse gases \n(GHGs) or aerosols) based on a coherent and internally consistent \nset of assumptions about driving forces (such as demographic \nand socio-economic development, technological change, energy \nand land use) and their key relationships.

    "text": "he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the \nassessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide an authoritative international \nassessment of the scientiﬁc aspects of climate change, based on the most recent scientiﬁc, technical, \nand socio-economic information published worldwide. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, \nimpacts and possible response strategies to climate change are the most comprehensive and \nup-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with \nclimate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth \nelement of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2021/2023. More than 800 international \nexperts assessed climate change in this Sixth Assessment Report.
