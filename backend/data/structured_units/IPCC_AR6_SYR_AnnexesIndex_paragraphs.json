A more comprehensive, \nharmonised set of deﬁnitions for terms used in this SYR and the \nthree AR6 Working Group reports is available from the IPCC \nOnline Glossary: https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/\nReaders are requested to refer to this comprehensive online \nglossary for deﬁnitions of terms of a more technical nature, and \nfor scientiﬁc references relevant to individual terms. Italicized \nwords indicate that the term is deﬁned in this or/and the online \nglossary. Subterms appear in italics beneath main terms. \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \nA UN resolution in September 2015 aadopting a plan of action for \npeople, planet and prosperity in a new global development framework \nanchored in 17 Sustainable Development Goals. \n \nAbrupt climate change\nA large-scale abrupt change in the climate system that takes place over \na few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least \na few decades and causes substantial impacts in human and/or natural \nsystems. See also: Abrupt change, Tipping point.\nAdaptation\nIn human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected \nclimate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneﬁcial \nopportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual \nclimate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment \nto expected climate and its effects. See also: Adaptation options, \nAdaptive capacity, Maladaptive actions (Maladaptation). \nAdaptation gap \nThe difference between actually implemented adaptation and a \nsocietally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to \ntolerated climate change impacts and reﬂecting resource limitations \nand competing priorities. \n \nAdaptation limits \nThe point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be \nsecured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. \n•  Hard adaptation limit - No adaptive actions are possible to \navoid intolerable risks. \n•  Soft adaptation limit - Options may exist but are currently \nnot available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive \naction.\n \nTransformational adaptation \nAdaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a \nsocial-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and \nits impacts. \nAerosol\nA suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with typical particle \nsize in the range of a few nanometres to several tens of micrometres \nand atmospheric lifetimes of up to several days in the troposphere \nand up to years in the stratosphere. The term aerosol, which includes \nboth the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report \nin its plural form to mean ‘aerosol particles’. Aerosols may be of either \nnatural or anthropogenic origin in the troposphere; stratospheric \naerosols mostly stem from volcanic eruptions. Aerosols can cause an \neffective radiative forcing directly through scattering and absorbing \nradiation (aerosol–radiation interaction), and indirectly by acting as \ncloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles that affect the \nproperties of clouds (aerosol–cloud interaction), and upon deposition \non snow- or ice-covered surfaces. Atmospheric aerosols may be either \nemitted as primary particulate matter or formed within the atmosphere \nfrom gaseous precursors (secondary production). Aerosols may be \ncomposed of sea salt, organic carbon, black carbon (BC), mineral \nspecies (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate and ammonium or \ntheir mixtures. See also: Particulate matter (PM), Aerosol–radiation \ninteraction, Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). \nAfforestation \nConversion to forest of land that historically has not contained forests. \nSee also: Anthropogenic removals, Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), \nDeforestation, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest \nDegradation (REDD+), Reforestation.\n[Note: For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as \nafforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the 2006 IPCC \nGuidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and their \n2019 Refinement, and information provided by the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change] \nAgricultural drought\nSee: Drought.\n \nAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nIn the context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under \nthe United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \nAFOLU is the sum of the GHG inventory sectors Agriculture and \nLand Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF); see the 2006 \nIPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories for details. Given the \ndifference in estimating the ‘anthropogenic’ carbon dioxide (CO2) \nremovals between countries and the global modelling community, the \nland-related net GHG emissions from global models included in this \nreport are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates \nin national GHG Inventories. See also: Land use, land-use change and \nforestry (LULUCF), Land-use change (LUC).  \nAgroforestry\nCollective name for land-use systems and technologies where woody \nperennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used \non the same land-management units as agricultural crops and/or \nanimals, in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence. \nIn agroforestry systems there are both ecological and economical \ninteractions between the different components. Agroforestry can \nalso be deﬁned as a dynamic, ecologically based, natural resource \nmanagement system that, through the integration of trees on farms",

See also: Ecosystem, Ecosystem services.\n  \nBioenergy \nEnergy derived from any form of biomass or its metabolic by-products. \nSee also: Biofuel.\n \nBioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)\nCarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology applied to \na bioenergy facility. Note that, depending on the total emissions \nof the BECCS supply chain, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be removed \nfrom the atmosphere. See also: Anthropogenic removals, \nCarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), Carbon dioxide removal (CDR).\nBlue carbon \nBiologically-driven carbon ﬂuxes and storage in marine systems that \nare amenable to management. Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted \nvegetation in the coastal zone, such as tidal marshes, mangroves and \nseagrasses. These ecosystems have high carbon burial rates on a per \nunit area basis and accumulate carbon in their soils and sediments. \nThey provide many non-climatic benefits and can contribute to \necosystem-based adaptation. If degraded or lost, coastal blue carbon \necosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back to the \natmosphere. There is current debate regarding the application of the \nblue carbon concept to other coastal and non-coastal processes and \necosystems, including the open ocean. See also: Ecosystem services, \nSequestration.\nBlue infrastructure\nSee: Infrastructure.\n  \nCarbon budget \nRefers to two concepts in the literature:  \n(1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level, \nthrough the synthesis of evidence for fossil fuel and cement emissions, \nemissions and removals associated with land use and land-use change, \nocean and natural land sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), \nand the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This is \nreferred to as the Global Carbon Budget; (2) the maximum amount of \ncumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions that would result in \nlimiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking \ninto account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is \nreferred to as the Total Carbon Budget when expressed starting from \nthe pre-industrial period, and as the Remaining Carbon Budget when \nexpressed from a recent speciﬁed date.\n[Note 1: Net anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anthropogenic \nCO2 emissions minus anthropogenic CO2 removals. See also: \nCarbon Dioxide Removal (CDR).  \nNote 2: The maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic \nCO2 emissions is reached at the time that annual net anthropogenic \nCO2 emissions reach zero. \nNote 3: The degree to which anthropogenic climate forcers other than \nCO2 affect the total carbon budget and remaining carbon budget \ndepends on human choices about the extent to which these forcers are \nmitigated and their resulting climate effects. \nNote 4: The notions of a total carbon budget and remaining carbon \nbudget are also being applied in parts of the scientiﬁc literature \nand by some entities at regional, national, or sub-national level. The \ndistribution of global budgets across individual different entities and \nemitters depends strongly on considerations of equity and other value \njudgements.] \nCarbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) \nA process in which a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) \nfrom industrial and energy-related sources is separated (captured), \nconditioned, compressed and transported to a storage location for \nlong-term isolation from the atmosphere. Sometimes referred to as \nCarbon Capture and Storage. See also: Anthropogenic removals, \nBioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS), \nCarbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU), Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), \nSequestration.\nCarbon dioxide removal (CDR) \nAnthropogenic activities removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the \natmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or \nocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential \nanthropogenic enhancement of biological or geochemical CO2 sinks \nand direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage (DACCS) but excludes \nnatural CO2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. \nSee also: Afforestation, Anthropogenic removals, Biochar, Bioenergy \nwith carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS), Carbon dioxide \ncapture and storage (CCS), Enhanced weathering, Ocean alkalinization/\nOcean alkalinity enhancement, Reforestation, Soil carbon sequestration (SCS).\n \nCascading impacts\nCascading impacts from extreme weather/climate events occur when \nan extreme hazard generates a sequence of secondary events in natural \nand human systems that result in physical, natural, social or economic \ndisruption, whereby the resulting impact is signiﬁcantly larger than the \ninitial impact. Cascading impacts are complex and multi-dimensional, \nand are associated more with the magnitude of vulnerability than with \nthat of the hazard.\nClimate \nIn a narrow sense, climate is usually deﬁned as the average weather \n-or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean \nand variability of relevant quantities- over a period of time ranging \nfrom months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period \nfor averaging these variables is 30 years, as deﬁned by the World",

The relevant quantities are most \noften surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. \nClimate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, \nof the climate system. \n \nClimate change \nA change in the state of the climate that can be identiﬁed (e.g., by using \nstatistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its \nproperties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades \nor longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes \nor external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic \neruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of \nthe atmosphere or in land use. See also: Climate variability, Detection \nand attribution, Global warming, Natural (climate) variability, Ocean \nacidiﬁcation (OA).\n[Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, deﬁnes climate change as: ‘a change \nof climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity \nthat alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in \naddition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time \nperiods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change \nattributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition \nand climate variability attributable to natural causes.]\nClimate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) \nThe occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above \n(or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range \nof observed values of the variable. By deﬁnition, the characteristics of \nwhat is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an \nabsolute sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some \ntime, such as a season, it may be classiﬁed as an extreme climate event, \nespecially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high \ntemperature, drought, or heavy rainfall over a season). For simplicity, \nboth extreme weather events and extreme climate events are referred \nto collectively as ‘climate extremes’. \nClimate ﬁnance \nThere is no agreed deﬁnition of climate ﬁnance. The term ‘climate \nﬁnance’ is applied to the ﬁnancial resources devoted to addressing \nclimate change by all public and private actors from global to local \nscales, including international ﬁnancial ﬂows to developing countries \nto assist them in addressing climate change. Climate ﬁnance aims to \nreduce net greenhouse gas emissions and/or to enhance adaptation \nand increase resilience to the impacts of current and projected climate \nchange. Finance can come from private and public sources, channelled \nby various intermediaries, and is delivered by a range of instruments, \nincluding grants, concessional and non-concessional debt, and internal \nbudget reallocations. \n \nClimate governance   \nThe structures, processes, and actions through which private and public \nactors seek to mitigate and adapt to climate change. \nClimate justice\nSee: Justice.\nClimate literacy \nClimate literacy encompasses being aware of climate change, its \nanthropogenic causes, and implications. \n \nClimate resilient development (CRD) \nClimate-resilient development refers to the process of implementing \ngreenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support \nsustainable development for all. \n  \nClimate sensitivity \nThe change in the surface temperature in response to a change in the \natmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration or other radiative \nforcing. See also: Climate feedback parameter. \n \nEquilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)  \nThe equilibrium (steady state) change in the surface temperature \nfollowing a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) \nconcentration from pre-industrial conditions.  \nClimate services \nClimate services involve the provision of climate information in such \na way as to assist decision-making. The service includes appropriate \nengagement from users and providers, is based on scientiﬁcally credible \ninformation and expertise, has an effective access mechanism, and \nresponds to user needs. \n \nClimate system \nThe global system consisting of ﬁve major components: the atmosphere, \nthe hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere, \nand the interactions between them. The climate system changes in \ntime under the inﬂuence of its own internal dynamics and because of \nexternal forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, orbital \nforcing, and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition \nof the atmosphere and land-use change. \n  \nClimatic impact-driver (CID)\nPhysical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) \nthat affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system \ntolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneﬁcial, neutral \nor a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. \nSee also: Hazard, Impacts, Risk.\nCO2-equivalent emission (CO2-eq)\nThe amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission that would have an \nequivalent effect on a speciﬁed key measure of climate change, over \na speciﬁed time horizon, as an emitted amount of another greenhouse \ngas (GHG) or a mixture of other GHGs. For a mix of GHGs it is obtained \nby summing the CO2-equivalent emissions of each gas. There are \nvarious ways and time horizons to compute such equivalent emissions \n(see greenhouse gas emission metric). CO2-equivalent emissions are \ncommonly used to compare emissions of different GHGs but should not \nbe taken to imply that these emissions have an equivalent effect across \nall key measures of climate change.\n[Note: Under the Paris Rulebook [Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph \n37], parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or \nGWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report",

Several categorisations \nare used in this report. (1) In the United Nations (UN) system, there \nis no established convention for the designation of developed and \ndeveloping countries or areas. (2) The UN Statistics Division speciﬁes \ndeveloped and developing regions based on common practice. In \naddition, speciﬁc countries are designated as least developed countries, \nlandlocked developing countries, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), \nand transition economies. Many countries appear in more than one of \nthese categories. (3) The World Bank uses income as the main criterion \nfor classifying countries as low, lower middle, upper middle, and high \nincome. (4) The UN Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates \nindicators for life expectancy, educational attainment, and income \ninto a single composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify \ncountries as low, medium, high, or very high human development.  \nDevelopment pathways\nSee: Pathways.\n \nDisaster risk management (DRM) \nProcesses for designing, implementing and evaluating strategies, \npolicies and measures to improve the understanding of current and \nfuture disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and \npromote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, prevention \nand protection, response and recovery practices, with the explicit \npurpose of increasing human security, well-being, quality of life and \nsustainable development (SD). \nDisplacement (of humans) \nThe involuntary movement, individually or collectively, of persons \nfrom their country or community, notably for reasons of armed conﬂict, \ncivil unrest, or natural or human-made disasters. \n \nDrought \nAn exceptional period of water shortage for existing ecosystems and the \nhuman population (due to low rainfall, high temperature and/or wind). \nSee also: Plant evaporative stress.\n \nAgricultural and ecological drought \nDepending on the affected biome: a period with abnormal \nsoil moisture deﬁcit, which results from combined shortage of \nprecipitation and excess evapotranspiration, and during the growing \nseason impinges on crop production or ecosystem function in \ngeneral.\n \nEarly warning systems (EWS) \nThe set of technical and institutional capacities to forecast, predict, and \ncommunicate timely and meaningful warning information to enable \nindividuals, communities, managed ecosystems, and organisations \nthreatened by a hazard to prepare to act promptly and appropriately \nto reduce the possibility of harm or loss. Depending upon context, EWS \nmay draw upon scientiﬁc and/or Indigenous knowledge, and other \nknowledge types. EWS are also considered for ecological applications, \ne.g., conservation, where the organisation itself is not threatened by \nhazard but the ecosystem under conservation is (e.g., coral bleaching alerts), \nin agriculture (e.g., warnings of heavy rainfall, drought, ground frost, \nand hailstorms) and in ﬁsheries (e.g., warnings of storm, storm surge, \nand tsunamis). \nEcological drought\nSee: Drought.\nEcosystem \nAn ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, \ntheir nonliving environment and the interactions within and between \nthem. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial \nboundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is deﬁned: \nin some cases, they are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse. \nEcosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems are nested \nwithin other ecosystems and their scale can range from very small to \nthe entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain \npeople as key organisms, or are inﬂuenced by the effects of human \nactivities in their environment.

Food waste is part of food \nloss and refers to discarding or alternative (non-food) use of food that \nis safe and nutritious for human consumption along the entire food \nsupply chain, from primary production to end household consumer \nlevel. Food waste is recognized as a distinct part of food loss because \nthe drivers that generate it and the solutions to it are different from \nthose of food losses. \n \nFood security \nA situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social \nand economic access to sufﬁcient, safe and nutritious food that meets \ntheir dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. \nThe four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization and \nstability. The nutritional dimension is integral to the concept of food \nsecurity. \nGlobal warming \nGlobal warming refers to the increase in global surface temperature \nrelative to a baseline reference period, averaging over a period \nsufficient to remove interannual variations (e.g., 20 or 30 years). A \ncommon choice for the baseline is 1850–1900 (the earliest period \nof reliable observations with sufficient geographic coverage), with \nmore modern baselines used depending upon the application. \nSee also: Climate change, Climate variability, Natural (climate) \nvariability.\n \nGlobal warming potential (GWP) \nAn index measuring the radiative forcing following an emission of a unit \nmass of a given substance, accumulated over a chosen time horizon, \nrelative to that of the reference substance, carbon dioxide (CO2).

For many \nIndigenous Peoples, IK informs decision-making about fundamental \naspects of life, from day-to-day activities to longer term actions. This \nknowledge is integral to cultural complexes, which also encompass \nlanguage, systems of classiﬁcation, resource use practices, social \ninteractions, values, ritual and spirituality. These distinctive ways of \nknowing are important facets of the world’s cultural diversity.

Since managed land may include carbon \ndioxide (CO2) removals not considered as ‘anthropogenic’ in some of the \nscientiﬁc literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with \nCO2 fertilisation and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission \nestimates from global models included in this report are not necessarily \ndirectly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories \n(IPCC 2006, 2019). \n \nLeast Developed Countries (LDCs) \nA list of countries designated by the Economic and Social Council of the \nUnited Nations (ECOSOC) as meeting three criteria: (1) a low income \ncriterion below a certain threshold of gross national income per capita \nof between USD 750 and USD 900, (2) a human resource weakness \nbased on indicators of health, education, adult literacy, and (3) an \neconomic vulnerability weakness based on indicators on instability \nof agricultural production, instability of export of goods and services, \neconomic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export \nconcentration, and the handicap of economic smallness. Countries in this \ncategory are eligible for a number of programmes focused on assisting \ncountries most in need. These privileges include certain beneﬁts under \nthe articles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC).  \n \nLivelihood \nThe resources used and the activities undertaken in order for people to \nlive. Livelihoods are usually determined by the entitlements and assets \nto which people have access. Such assets can be categorised as human, \nsocial, natural, physical or ﬁnancial. \n \nLocal knowledge (LK) \nThe understandings and skills developed by individuals and \npopulations, speciﬁc to the places where they live. Local knowledge \ninforms decision-making about fundamental aspects of life, from \nday-to-day activities to longer term actions. This knowledge is a \nkey element of the social and cultural systems which inﬂuence \nobservations of and responses to climate change; it also informs \ngovernance decisions.

To better inform risk \nassessment and decision-making, such low-likelihood outcomes are \nconsidered if they are associated with very large consequences and may \ntherefore constitute material risks, even though those consequences do \nnot necessarily represent the most likely outcome. See also: Impacts. \n \nMaladaptive actions (Maladaptation) \nActions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related \noutcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nincreased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable \noutcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, \nmaladaptation is an unintended consequence. \n  \nMigration (of humans) \nMovement of a person or a group of persons, either across an \ninternational border, or within a State. It is a population movement, \nencompassing any kind of movement of people, whatever its length, \ncomposition and causes; it includes migration of refugees, displaced \npersons, economic migrants, and persons moving for other purposes, \nincluding family reuniﬁcation. \n \nMitigation (of climate change) \nA human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of \ngreenhouse gases.  \n \nMitigation potential \nThe quantity of net greenhouse gas emission reductions that can be \nachieved by a given mitigation option relative to speciﬁed emission \nbaselines. See also: Sequestration potential.\n[Note: Net greenhouse gas emission reductions is the sum of reduced \nemissions and/or enhanced sinks]\nNatural (climate) variability \nNatural variability refers to climatic ﬂuctuations that occur without \nany human inﬂuence, that is internal variability combined with the \nresponse to external natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, \nchanges in solar activity and, on longer time-scales, orbital effects and \nplate tectonics.

The quantiﬁcation of net zero \nGHG emissions depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare \nemissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon \nchosen for that metric.

At a global scale, the terms GHG neutrality and \nnet zero GHG emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net \nzero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals \nunder direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, \nwhile GHG neutrality generally includes anthropogenic emissions \nand anthropogenic removals within and beyond the direct control \nor territorial responsibility of the reporting entity.

In addition, parties may \nuse other metrics to report supplemental information on aggregate \nemissions and removals of GHGs.]\nNew Urban Agenda \nThe New Urban Agenda was adopted at the United Nations Conference \non Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in Quito, \nEcuador, on 20 October 2016. It was endorsed by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth plenary meeting of the seventy-ﬁrst session \non 23 December 2016. \nOvershoot pathways\nSee: Pathways.\n  \nPathways \nThe temporal evolution of natural and/or human systems towards \na future state. Pathway concepts range from sets of quantitative \nand qualitative scenarios or narratives of potential futures to \nsolution-oriented decision-making processes to achieve desirable \nsocietal goals. Pathway approaches typically focus on biophysical, \ntechno-economic and/or socio-behavioural trajectories and involve \nvarious dynamics, goals and actors across different scales. See also: \nScenario, Storyline. \n \nDevelopment pathways \nDevelopment pathways evolve as the result of the countless \ndecisions being made and actions being taken at all levels of societal \nstructure, as well due to the emergent dynamics within and between \ninstitutions, cultural norms, technological systems and other drivers \nof behavioural change. See also: Shifting development pathways \n(SDPs), Shifting development pathways to sustainability (SDPS). \nEmission pathways \nModelled trajectories of global anthropogenic emissions over \nthe 21st century are termed emission pathways. \n \nOvershoot pathways \nPathways that ﬁrst exceed a speciﬁed concentration, forcing or \nglobal warming level, and then return to or below that level again \nbefore the end of a speciﬁed period of time (e.g., before 2100). \nSometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot are also \ncharacterised. The overshoot duration can vary from one pathway \nto the next, but in most overshoot pathways in the literature and \nreferred to as overshoot pathways in the AR6, the overshoot occurs \nover a period of at least one decade and up to several decades. \nSee also: Temperature overshoot.\n \nShared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) \nShared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) have been developed to \ncomplement the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). By \ndesign, the RCP emission and concentration pathways were stripped \nof their association with a certain socio-economic development. \nDifferent levels of emissions and climate change along the \ndimension of the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop \nof different socio-economic development pathways (SSPs) on the \nother dimension in a matrix. This integrative SSP-RCP framework is \nnow widely used in the climate impact and policy analysis literature \n(see, e.g., http://iconics-ssp.org), where climate projections obtained \nunder the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of \nvarious SSPs. As several emission updates were due, a new set of \nemission scenarios was developed in conjunction with the SSPs. \nHence, the abbreviation SSP is now used for two things: On the one \nhand SSP1, SSP2, …, SSP5 is used to denote the ﬁve socio-economic \nscenario families. On the other hand, the abbreviations SSP1-1.9, \nSSP1-2.6, …, SSP5-8.5 are used to denote the newly developed \nemission scenarios that are the result of an SSP implementation \nwithin an integrated assessment model. Those SSP scenarios are \nbare of climate policy assumption, but in combination with so-called \nshared policy assumptions (SPAs), various approximate radiative \nforcing levels of 1.9, 2.6, …, or 8.5 W m−2 are reached by the \nend of the century, respectively. denote trajectories that address \nsocial, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment, adaptation and mitigation, and transformation, in a \ngeneric sense or from a particular methodological perspective such \nas integrated assessment models and scenario simulations. \n \nPlanetary health \nA concept based on the understanding that human health and human \ncivilisation depend on ecosystem health and the wise stewardship of \necosystems. \n  \nReasons for concern (RFCs) \nElements of a classiﬁcation framework, ﬁrst developed in the IPCC Third \nAssessment Report, which aims to facilitate judgements about what \nlevel of climate change may be dangerous (in the language of Article \n2 of the UNFCCC; UNFCCC, 1992) by aggregating risks from various \nsectors, considering hazards, exposures, vulnerabilities, capacities to \nadapt, and the resulting impacts.",

Lastly, just transitions may embody the \nredressing of past harms and perceived injustices. \n \nUrban \nThe categorisation of areas as “urban” by government statistical \ndepartments is generally based either on population size, population \ndensity, economic base, provision of services, or some combination \nof the above. Urban systems are networks and nodes of intensive \ninteraction and exchange including capital, culture, and material \nobjects. Urban areas exist on a continuum with rural areas and tend to \nexhibit higher levels of complexity, higher populations and population \ndensity, intensity of capital investment, and a preponderance of \nsecondary (processing) and tertiary (service) sector industries. The \nextent and intensity of these features varies signiﬁcantly within and \nbetween urban areas. Urban places and systems are open, with much \nmovement and exchange between more rural areas as well as other \nurban regions. Urban areas can be globally interconnected, facilitating \nrapid ﬂows between them, of capital investment, of ideas and culture, human \nmigration, and disease. See also: Cities, City region, Peri-urban areas, \nUrban Systems, Urbanisation.\n \nUrbanisation \nUrbanisation is a multi-dimensional process that involves at least \nthree simultaneous changes: 1) land use change: transformation of \nformerly rural settlements or natural land into urban settlements; \n2) demographic change: a shift in the spatial distribution of a population \nfrom rural to urban areas; and 3) infrastructure change: an increase in \nprovision of infrastructure services including electricity, sanitation, etc. \nUrbanisation often includes changes in lifestyle, culture, and behaviour, \nand thus alters the demographic, economic, and social structure of both \nurban and rural areas. See also: Settlement, Urban, Urban Systems.\n \nVector-borne disease \nIllnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted \nby various vectors (e.g. mosquitoes, sandﬂies, triatomine bugs, blackﬂies, \nticks, tsetse ﬂies, mites, snails and lice). \n \nVulnerability \nThe propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability \nencompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or \nsusceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. See also: \nHazard, Exposure, Impacts, Risk.\n  \nWater security \nThe capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate \nquantities of acceptable-quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human \nwell-being and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection \nagainst water-borne pollution and water-related disasters and for \npreserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability. \n \nWell-being \nA state of existence that fulﬁlls various human needs, including \nmaterial living conditions and quality of life, as well as the ability \nto pursue one’s goals, to thrive and to feel satisﬁed with one’s life. \nEcosystem well-being refers to the ability of ecosystems to maintain \ntheir diversity and quality.",
