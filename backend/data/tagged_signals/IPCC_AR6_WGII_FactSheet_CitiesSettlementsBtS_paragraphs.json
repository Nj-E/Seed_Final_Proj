    "text": "SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability On the climate change frontline Much of the world’s population, economic activities and critical infrastructure are concentrated near the sea (high confidence), with nearly 11% of the global population, or 896 million people, already living on low-lying coasts directly exposed to interacting climatic and non- climatic coastal hazards (very high confidence). {CCP2-ES} The population potentially exposed to a 100-year coastal flood is projected to increase by about 20% if global mean sea level rises by 0.15 m relative to 2020 levels; this exposed population doubles at a 0.75 m rise in mean sea level and triples at 1.4 m without population change and additional adaptation (medium confidence). By 2100 the value of global assets within the future 1-in-100 year coastal floodplains is projected to be between US$7.9 and US$12.7 trillion (2011 value) under RCP4.5*, rising to between US$8.8 and US$14.2 trillion under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {SPM.B.4.5} Under all climate and socioeconomic scenarios, low-lying cities and settlements, small islands, Arctic communities, remote Indigenous communities and deltaic communities will face severe disruption by 2100, and as early as 2050 in many cases (very high confidence). {TS.C.5.3} Cities and settlements by the sea are thus on the frontline of action to adapt to climate change, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and chart climate resilient development pathways. {CCP2.1.1} Take an adaptation pathways approach A mix of interventions is necessary to manage coastal risks and build resilience over time. An adaptation-pathways approach sets out near-term ‘low-regret’ actions that align with societal goals, facilitates implementation of a locally appropriate sequence of interventions in the face of uncertain climate and development futures, and enables necessary transformation (high confidence). {CCP2-ES} A mix of infrastructural, nature-based, institutional and sociocultural interventions are needed to reduce the multifaceted risk facing cities and settlements, including vulnerability-reducing measures, avoidance (i.e., disincentivising developments in high-risk areas), hard and soft protection, accommodation, advance (i.e., building up and out to sea) and retreat (i.e., landward movement of people and development) (very high confidence). {CCP2-ES} Build adaptive capacity Locally appropriate institutional capabilities, including regulatory provisions and finances dedicated to maintaining healthy coastal socioecological systems, build adaptive capacity in cities and settlements by the sea (high confidence). Implementing integrated multi-level coastal zone governance, pre-emptive planning, enabling behavioural change and alignment of financial resources with a wide set of values will provide cities and settlements with greater flexibility to open up the solution space to adapt to climate change (high confidence). Insufficient financial resources are a key constraint for coastal adaptation, particularly in the Global South (high confidence). Engaging the private sector in coastal adaptation action with a range of financial tools is crucial to address the coastal adaptation funding gap (high confidence). Considering the full range of economic and non-economic values will improve adaptation effectiveness and equity across cities and settlements archetypes (high confidence). Aligning adaptation in cities and settlements with socioeconomic development, infrastructure maintenance and COVID-19 recovery investments will provide additional co-benefits. Urgency is also driven by the need to avoid lock-in to new and additional risk, for example",

Extensive adaptation planning has been undertaken since the IPCC Fifth Assessment\nReport (AR5), but there has not been widespread effective implementation, thus giving rise to a ‘coastal adaptation gap’ (high confidence).\nTo date, most interventions have been reactive and often rely on protective works alone (high confidence). {CCP2-ES}\nThe effectiveness of alternative interventions differs among cities and settlements archetypes, while their feasibility is influenced by\ngeomorphology and socioeconomic conditions as well cultural, political and institutional considerations (very high confidence). Mismatches\nbetween adaptation needs and patterns of physical development are commonplace in many coastal cities and settlements, with particularly\nadverse impacts on poor and marginalised communities in the Global North and Global South (high confidence). Overcoming this gap is\nkey to transitioning towards climate resilient development (medium confidence). Under higher warming levels and higher sea level rise,\nincreasingly dichotomous coastal futures will become more entrenched (medium confidence), with stark differences between more\nurbanised, resource-rich coastal cities and settlements dependent on hard protection, and more rural, resource-poor cities and settlements\nfacing displacement and migration. {CCP2-ES; Table CCP2.1}\n2\nClimate Resilient Development\nKey enablers for charting climate resilient development pathways\nCoastal adaptation innovators adopt more flexible, anticipatory and integrative strategies, combining technical and non-technical\ninterventions that account for uncertainties and facilitate effective resolution of conflicting interests and worldviews (limited evidence, high\nagreement). Moreover, a core set of critical enablers is foundational for cities and settlements to chart climate resilient development\npathways. {CCP2-ES; Table CCP2.1}\nCities and settlements play a pivotal role in global aspirations to implement the Paris Agreement, advance the Sustainable Development\nGoals, and foster climate resilient development. Progress towards these ends depends on the extent to which cities and settlements\nmobilise urgent and transformational changes to institutionalise enabling conditions, close the coastal adaptation gap by addressing the\ndrivers and root causes of exposure and vulnerability to climate-compounded coastal hazard risks, and drastically reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions (medium confidence). {CCP2-ES}\nVersion published November 2022",
