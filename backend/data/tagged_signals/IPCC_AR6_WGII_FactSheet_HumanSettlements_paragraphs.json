    "text": "SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Concentrated risk and concentrated opportunity for action Cities and settlements are crucial for delivering urgent climate action. The concentration and interconnection of people, infrastructure and assets within and across cities and into rural areas drives the creation of risks and solutions at a global scale (high confidence). {TS.D.6} Globally, urban populations grew by more than 397 million people between 2015 and 2020, with more than 90% of this growth taking place in less developed regions. The most rapid growth in urban vulnerability has been in unplanned and informal settlements and in smaller to medium urban centres in low- and middle-income nations where adaptive capacity is limited (high confidence). {TS.B.8.1} Key impacts Globally, exposure to climate-driven impacts such as heatwaves, extreme precipitation and storms in combination with rapid urbanisation and lack of climate-sensitive planning, along with continuing threats from urban heat islands, is increasing the vulnerability of marginalised urban populations and key infrastructure to climate change, for example, more frequent and/or extreme rainfall and drought stress existing design and capacity of current urban water systems and heighten urban and peri-urban water insecurity (high confidence). {TS.B.8.1} COVID-19 has had a substantial urban impact and generated new climate-vulnerable populations (high confidence). {TS.B.8.1} Climate impacts on urban population health, livelihoods and well-being are felt disproportionately, with the most economically and socially marginalised being most affected (high confidence) {TS.B.8.3} Urban areas and their infrastructure are susceptible to both compounding and cascading risks arising from interactions between severe weather from climate change and increasing urbanisation (medium evidence, high agreement). Losses become systemic when they affect entire systems and can even jump from one system to another (e.g., drought impacting rural food production contributing to urban food insecurity) (medium confidence). {TS.C.11.5} Coastal cities Coastal cities are disproportionately affected by interacting, cascading and climate-compounding climate- and ocean-driven impacts, in part because of the exposure of multiple assets, economic activities and large populations concentrated in narrow coastal zones (high confidence). Early impacts of accelerating sea level rise have been detected at sheltered or subsiding coasts, manifesting as nuisance and chronic flooding at high tides, water-table salinisation, ecosystem and agricultural transitions, increased erosion and coastal flood damage (medium confidence). Coastal settlements with high inequality, for example a high proportion of informal settlements, as well as deltaic cities prone to land subsidence and small island states are highly vulnerable and have experienced impacts from severe storms and floods in addition to, or in combination with, those from accelerating sea level rise (high confidence). {TS.B.8.2} Risks to coastal cities and settlements are projected to increase by at least one order of magnitude by 2100 without significant adaptation and mitigation action (high confidence). The population at risk in coastal cities and settlements from a 100-year coastal flood increases by approx. 20% if the global mean sea level rises by 0.15 m relative to current levels, doubles at 0.75 m and triples at 1.4 m, assuming present-day population and protection height (high confidence). {TS.C.5.4} Realising global aspirations for climate resilient development depends on the extent",

    "text": "SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT\nWorking Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\nInertia, maladaptation and limits to adaptation\nMaladaptation has been observed across many regions and\nsystems and occurs\nfor many reasons, including\ninadequate\nknowledge and short-term, fragmented, single-sectoral and/or\nnon-inclusive governance planning and implementation (high\nconfidence). Examples include in urban areas, e.g., inflexible\ninfrastructure in cities and settlements that cannot be adjusted\neasily or affordably for increased heavy rainfall and human\nsettlements, e.g., stranded assets and stranded vulnerable\ncommunities that cannot afford to shift away or adapt and require\nand increase in social safety nets. {TS.D.3.1}\nConsidering the long term now will help avoid maladaptive lock-in,\nto build capacity to act in a timely and pre-emptive manner and to\nreduce risks to ecosystems and people. {TS.D.7.1} Approaches\nthat break down adaptation into manageable steps over time and\nuse pathway analyses to determine low-regret actions for the\nnear-term and long-term options are a useful starting point for\nadaptation (medium confidence). {TS.D.10.5}\nLimits to adaptation will be reached in more systems, including,\nfor example, coastal communities, water security, agricultural\nproduction and human health, as global warming increases\n(medium confidence). {TS.D.2.3}\nFigure 1: The size of the circle represents the number of people at risk per IPCC region and the colours show the timing of risk based on projected \npopulation change and sea level rise under SSP2-4.5*. Darker colours indicate earlier in setting risks. The left side of the circles shows absolute \nprojected population at risk and the right side the share of the population in percentage. {Figure TS.9c}. \nKey adaptation options\nA\nmix\nof\ninfrastructure,\nnature-based,\ninstitutional\nand\nsociocultural .interventions can best address the risks. The\noptions include vulnerability-reducing measures, avoidance (e.g.,\ndisincentivising developments in high-risk areas and addressing\nexisting social vulnerabilities), hard and soft protection (e.g., sea\nwalls, coastal wetlands), accommodation (e.g., elevating houses),\nadvance (e.g., building up and out to sea) and staged, managed\nretreat (e.g., landward movement of people and development)\ninterventions (very high confidence). {TS.D.7.3}\nDisaster risk management, climate services and risk sharing,\nincrease the feasibility and effectiveness of other options by\nexpanding\nthe\nsolution\nspace\navailable\n(high\nconfidence).{TS.D.11.1}\nThere is high confidence in the economic and ecological feasibility\nof green infrastructure and ecosystem services, as well as\nsustainable urban water management, once institutional barriers\nin the form of limited social and political acceptability are\novercome. {TS.E.1.4}\nCo-benefits and synergies of adaptation\nUrban adaptation measures have many opportunities to contribute to climate resilient development pathways (medium confidence). They\ncan enhance social capital, livelihoods, human and ecological health and contribute to low-carbon futures. Urban planning, social policy\nand nature-based solutions bring great flexibility with co-benefits for climate mitigation and sustainable development. Participatory\nplanning for infrastructure provision and risk management in informal, precarious and underserved neighbourhoods, the inclusion of\nIndigenous knowledge and local knowledge, and communication and efforts to build local leadership especially among women and youth\nare examples of inclusive approaches with co-benefits for equity. {TS.D.6.6}\n2\n* Please see ‚Introduction to WGII AR6 Fact Sheets’",

Supplementary Material 6.3 provides a\ndetailed analysis including definitions for each component of climate resilient development and the evidences. {Figure TS.9d}\nFinance and governance\nKey innovations in adaptation in social policy and nature-based solutions have not been matched by innovation in adaptation finance,\nwhich tends to favour established mechanisms, often led by grey/physical infrastructure at the national scale. {TS.D.6.5} Governance\ncapacity, financial support and the legacy of past urban infrastructure investment constrain how all cities and settlements are able to\nadapt (high confidence). Limits to adaptation are often most pronounced in rapidly growing towns and cities and smaller settlements\nincluding those without dedicated local government. {ES-Ch6}\nAccess to finance is most difficult for city, local and non-state actors, and in conditions where governance is fragile. {ES-Ch6} This\nhighlights the significance of addressing underlying inequalities in development that shape differential vulnerability. {6.3.2}\nClimate governance will be most effective when it has meaningful and ongoing involvement of all societal actors from local to global levels\n(very high confidence).
