Climate-\ndriven impacts on ecosystems have caused measurable economic\nand\nlivelihood\nlosses\nand\naltered\ncultural\npractices\nand\nrecreational activities around the world (high confidence). {TS.B.1}\nExtreme climate events comprising conditions beyond which many\nspecies are adapted are occurring on all continents, with severe\nimpacts (very high confidence). The most severe impacts are\noccurring in the most climate-sensitive species and ecosystems,\ncharacterised by traits that limit their abilities to regenerate\nbetween events or to adapt, and those most exposed to climate\nhazards (high confidence). {TS.B.2.1}\nFact sheet - Biodiversity\nFuture risks\nThreats to species and ecosystems in oceans, coastal regions\nand on land, particularly in biodiversity hotspots, present a global\nrisk that will increase with every additional tenth of a degree of\nwarming (high confidence). The transformation of terrestrial and\nocean/coastal ecosystems and loss of biodiversity, exacerbated\nby pollution, habitat fragmentation and land use changes, will\nthreaten livelihoods and food security (high confidence). {TS.C.1}\nWithout urgent and deep emissions reductions, some species and\necosystems, especially those in polar and already-warm areas,\nwill face temperatures beyond their historical experience in the\nnext decades (e.g., >20% of species on some tropical landscapes\nand coastlines at 1.5°C global warming). Unique and threatened\necosystems are expected to be at high risk in the very near term\nat 1.2°C global warming levels (very high confidence) due to\nmass tree mortality, coral reef bleaching, large declines in sea-\nice-dependent\nspecies\nand\nmass\nmortality\nevents\nfrom\nheatwaves. {TS.C.1.1}\nClimate Change Impacts and Risks\nFigure 1: Observed global and regional impacts on ecosystems attributed to climate change.

    "text": "SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Marine heatwaves Marine heatwaves, including well-documented events along the west coast of North America (2013–2016) and east coast of Australia (2015– 2016, 2016–2017 and 2020), drive abrupt shifts in community composition that may persist for years (very high confidence), with associated biodiversity loss (very high confidence), collapse of regional fisheries and aquaculture (high confidence) and reduced capacity of habitat-forming species to protect shorelines (high confidence). {ES-Ch3} Some habitat-forming coastal ecosystems including many coral reefs, kelp forests and seagrass meadows, will undergo irreversible phase shifts due to marine heatwaves with global warming levels >1.5°C and are at high risk this century even in <1.5°C scenarios that include periods of temperature overshoot beyond 1.5°C (high confidence). Under SSP1- 2.6**, coral reefs are at risk of widespread decline, loss of structural integrity and transitioning to net erosion by mid-century due to increasing intensity and frequency of marine heatwaves (very high confidence). {ES-Ch3} Sea level rise Risks from sea level rise for coastal ecosystems and people are very likely to increase tenfold well before 2100 without adaptation and mitigation action as agreed by Parties to the Paris Agreement (very high confidence). Sea level rise under emission scenarios that do not limit warming to 1.5°C will increase the risk of coastal erosion and submergence of coastal land (high confidence), loss of coastal habitat and ecosystems (high confidence) and worsen salinisation of groundwater (high confidence), compromising coastal ecosystems and livelihoods (high confidence). {ES-Ch3} The ability to adapt to current coastal impacts, cope with future coastal risks and prevent further acceleration of sea level rise beyond 2050 depends on immediate implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions (very high confidence). {ES-Ch3} Species extinction Local population extinctions caused by climate change have been widespread among plants and animals, detected in 47% of 976 species examined and associated with increases in the hottest yearly temperatures (very high confidence). The white sub-species of the lemuroid ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides) in Queensland, Australia, disappeared after heatwaves in 2005 (high confidence): intensive censuses found only 2 individuals in 2009. The Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) was not seen after 2009 and was declared extinct in 2016, with sea level rise and increased storm surge associated with climate change being the most probable drivers (high confidence). {ES-Ch2} At warming levels beyond 2°C by 2100, risks of extirpation*, extinction and ecosystem collapse escalate rapidly (high confidence). Climate impacts on ocean and coastal ecosystems will be exacerbated by increases in intensity, reoccurrence and duration of marine heatwaves (high confidence), in some cases, leading to species extirpation, habitat collapse or surpassing ecological tipping points (very high confidence). {ES-Ch3} The risk of species extinction increases with warming in all climate change projections for native species studied in hotspots (high confidence), being about 10-times greater for endemic species from 1.5°C to 3°C above pre-industrial levels (medium confidence). Very high extinction risk in biodiversity hotspots due to climate change is more common for endemic species than other native species (high confidence). For these endemic species, considering all scenarios and time periods",

    "text": "SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Adaptation Options and Barriers Increasing the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change includes minimising additional stresses or disturbances, reducing fragmentation, increasing natural habitat extent, connectivity and heterogeneity, maintaining taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and redundancy and protecting small-scale refugia where microclimate conditions can allow species to persist (high confidence). {TS.D.4.2} Ecosystem protection and restoration can build resilience of ecosystems and generate opportunities to restore ecosystem services with substantial co-benefits (high confidence). {TS.D.4.1} Potential benefits and avoidance of harm are maximised when nature-based solutions are deployed in the right places and with the right approaches for those areas, with inclusive governance (high confidence). Taking account of interdisciplinary scientific information, Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and practical expertise is essential to effective ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence). {TS.D.4.7} Climate Resilient Development Synergies Available adaptation options can reduce risks to ecosystems and the services they provide, but they cannot prevent all changes and should not be regarded as a substitute for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (high confidence). Ambitious and swift global mitigation offers more adaptation options and pathways to sustain ecosystems and their services (high confidence). {TS.D.4.4} Planetary health Maintaining planetary health is essential for human and societal health and a pre-condition for climate resilient development (very high confidence). Effective ecosystem conservation on approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas, including all remaining areas with a high degree of naturalness and ecosystem integrity, will help protect biodiversity, build ecosystem resilience and ensure essential ecosystem services (high confidence). In addition to this protection, sustainable management of the rest of the planet is also important. {TS.E.4} Ecosystem services Climate change is affecting ecosystem services connected to human health, livelihoods and well-being (medium confidence). Deforestation, draining and burning of peatlands and tropical forests and thawing of Arctic permafrost have already shifted some areas from being carbon sinks to carbon sources (high confidence). The severity and outbreak extent of forest insect pests increased in several regions (high confidence). Woody plant expansion into grasslands and savannahs, linked to increased CO2, has reduced grazing land, while invasive grasses in semiarid lands increased the risk of fire (high confidence). {TS.B.1.5} Ecosystem services that are under threat from a combination of climate change and other anthropogenic pressures include climate change mitigation, flood risk management, food provisioning and water supply (high confidence). {ES-Ch2} Biodiversity hotspots All biodiversity hotspots are impacted, to differing degrees, by human activities (very high confidence). Climate change impacts are compounded by other anthropogenic impacts. These include habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting, fishing and its bycatch, over- exploitation, water abstraction, nutrient enrichment, pollution, human introduction of invasive species, pests and diseases. All of these reduce climate resilience (very high confidence). {ES-CCP1} Wildfire Regional increases in area burned by wildfires (up to double natural levels), tree mortality of up to 20%, and biome shifts of up to 20 km latitudinally and 300 m up-slope have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change in tropical, temperate and boreal ecosystems around the world (high confidence), damaging key",
